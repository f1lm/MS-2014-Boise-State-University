<big>W</big>ELCOME TO
         the Seventh Edition of <i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i>,
         a free, on-line textbook on introductory
         programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction.  This book is directed
         mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced
         programmers who want to learn something about Java.  It is certainly not meant to
         provide complete coverage of the Java language.
        </p>
<p>The seventh edition requires Java 7, with just a couple brief mentions of Java 8.
         Previous versions included Java applets
         on the web pages that make up this book, but the applets have been eliminated
         from this version.  Earlier editions of the book are still available; 
         see the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/preface.html">preface</a> for links.
         </p>
<p>You can the download this
         web site for use on your own computer. 
         PDF and print versions of the textbook are also available.
         The PDF that includes links might be the best way to read it on your computer.
         Links to the downloads can be found at the bottom of this page.
         </p>

         the book!  You can download the source code separately or as part of the web site using the links below.
