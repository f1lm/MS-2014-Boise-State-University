<h1>Cameleon <font color="#ffcc33">O</font>SP FAQ</h1>
<p><b>What does the comment "<tt>//elementary!</tt>" at the begin of a
class mean?</b>
<br>
It indicates the project setup utility, that the class should be copied
and adaptet, when a project is initialized on the base of an existing
project.
</p>
<p><b>Why don't you use XML to define your user interface in editorial
way?</b>
<br>
Well, we love our compiler! It indicates us our faults at compile time
easily. Thus, we reduce debug of runtime errors. Furthermore, Cameleon
OSP is "predominantly editorial", what means, we want to maintain the
programmers
power to do every individual stuff that he needs directly.
</p>
<p><b>Isn't the most important thing that you start projects with a
focus
on a multi tier design?</b>
<br>
No, we don't think so. We prefere to set our focus on the problem we
want to solve. Thus, we code the application technology independent.
Afterwards
we'll see where multi tier is necessary and switch it framework-sided
or
do that in detail individually. Concluding, we simply like to provide a
trend-setting architecture, which the middle classes may afford.
</p>
<p><b>What to do to support another database?</b>
<br>
Besides the technical aspects of finding a suitable driver, the SQL
dialect aspects are solved by isolating database specific syntax in
subclasses
of <a href="api/de/must/dataobj/SqlDialect.html">de.must.dataobj.SqlDialect</a>.
Build a new SqlDialect subclass based on a copy of the nearest version,
adapt and register it in <a
 href="api/de/must/dataobj/ConnectionHolder.html">de.must.dataobj.ConnectionHolder</a>.
