How to operate</h2></center>

<h3>
General</h3>
As a server application, the cookbook is depending on the capability of
your browser. A resemblance with Windows-Applications is wanted, however
limited. Particularly, the processing of many windows is put in the background.
Instead of it, a nesting of the application-functions with a return-logic
is important. This handling is under experts of mainframes very familiar.
<p>Remark: within the application, the use of "back" function (like the
"back" button of your browser) is not supported. In this case, please use
the "back" button of the application. So you go back to the page you came
from.
<h3>
Toolbar</h3>
The toolbar helps for a quick navigation to the most frequented functions.
It finishes the preceding step and starts the desired function. In this
case, a return to the preceeding function is not possible.

<img SRC="menu.jpg" ALT="Main menu" height=277 width=587>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The menu is hierarchical builded and comprises many steps. With the
button "Back", you go just one step back. The branch is based on cursor
and click.

<h3>
<a NAME="Search"></a>Enquiry/Search within the cookbook</h3>
<img SRC="search.jpg" ALT="your search" height=421 width=537> Helps you
to find recipes based on to one or more search arguments. Put your limitations
and press button "Listing".
<p><b>Remarks:</b>
<ul>
<li>
The combination of limitations is allowed. It helps to restrict the search
and get exact results.</li>

<li>
All given criterions are "AND-conditions", this means, the more you give
criterions, the less results you get.</li>

<li>
All search criterions are interpreted as generic, e.g. if you enter "carrot"
in the field "recipe-type", you will find "carrot salad" and "carrot soup",
if they exist. If you enter "carrot" in the field "ingredients", a list
of all recipes that contains the word "carrot" is displayed.</li>
</ul>
