<p>Above this text you should see a picture of a some shapes and a quote by
Albert Einstein. This picture is generated by a Java applet. If you don't see
the picture, it may be because your browser is not set up to process Java
applets (the browser needs the Java plug-in), or because the bytecode version
of the applet is not stored in the same location as this web page.</p>
