<b>PROJECT MOTIVATION:</b>
<p>
In the current cloud computing setting, if customers outsource their data to clouds, they
are actually forced to believe that the service providers will do their best 
to protect customers' data privacy. However, from customers' perspective, 
why should they trust service providers? Or more specifically why should they trust DBAs inside the service 
providers who are eligible to access their data? The trust issue in cloud computing is one of
the most difficult problems to overcome.


</p><p>
<b>PROJECT OBJECTIVE:</b>
</p><p>
This project tries to develop a semantic hiding database system to protect data privacy 
while outsourcing data to clouds. In other words, we try to resolve the trust issue in cloud computing.
Rather than creating clear database instances in clouds, customers create and outsource privacy protected
SHDBs to clouds through a user friendly API, named SHDB tool. As a result, even the DBAs in clouds are
malicious, they cannot easily guess any meaningful information from the outsourced SHDB instances.


</p><p>
<b>SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES:</b> 
</p><p>
In a relational database, each data item itself may not reveal too much semantics. 
If more correlated data items are available, the semantics become more obvious. 
For example, the following two records show how semantic hiding can be done.
</p><p>
<ol>
(A) In a PAYROLL database of an XYZ company, a record in the EMPLOYEE table shows that 
John Smith's SALARY is 75,000. <br>
(B) In a ? database of an ? company, a record in the ? table shows that ?'s ? is 75,000
</ol><table border="0" width="100%">

</table>
Each ? mark represents the cryptographic cipher of the corresponding semantic 
telling data (string type). 
Line A is not encrypted and thus if the data is outsourced to clouds, malicious or 
curious cloud DBAs can see the secret. 
In line B, all the semantic telling data including the identities/names 
(such as the data owner, database, table and attribute names) and string-typed data 
(such as John Smith) are all encrypted. 
The cloud DBAs can only see a number 75,000 and will have only a limited capability 
of guessing the meaning of that number. 
The reason of not encrypting the number is because no efficient fully homomorphic 
encryption algorithm exists so that both multiply and add operations can be applied directly 
on the numeric ciphers.
</p><p>
The semantic hiding database we proposed applies several encryption algorithms to 
co-encrypt the database so that the cloud server can still execute SQL queries over 
the encrypted database. 
The encryption strategy is to encrypt everything, except some certain numeric data. 
The encryption algorithms used include 
</p><p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr><td><ol>
<dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> Deterministic Encryption Algorithm (DEA): 
Encrypts the names (identities) of database, tables and attributes. AES with a fixed IV,  
MD5 and SHA are examples of such algorithms.<br>
 </dt><dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> Order-Preserved Encryption (OPE): 
Encrypts string type data if
the data is not subject to substring matching operations such as SQL "like" command. <br>
 </dt><dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> Order-Preserved Encryption in Word-by-Word mode (OPE-WbW): 
Encrypts string type data word-by-word if
the data is applicable to substring matching operations. <br>
 </dt><dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> Multiplicative-Homomorphic Encryption (MHE):
Encrypts numeric data if the data is applicable to multiplication only. 
RSA algorithm is a typical example for such algorithms. <br>
 </dt><dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE):
Encrypts numeric data if the data is applicable to addition only.  <br>
 </dt><dt> <img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "> For numeric data applicable to both addition and 
multiplication, a not-so secure polynomially-based homomorphic encoding 
(developed by the project adviser Dr. Jyh-haw Yeh) will be applied.
The encoding is not as secure as encryption algorithm and it is subject to known plaintext attacks,
but it does provide privacy protection is several aspects.

To further hide the semantics of unencrypted numeric data, SHDB use the following two techniques:
</p><p>
<ol>
<dt><img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "><b><em>Data obfuscation:</em></b> 
While creating an SHDB instance, to obfuscate each unencrypted numeric data column,
some false (not-real data) columns, with similar data range and format, will be injected to 
increase the data obfuscation. <br>
</dt><dt><img src="./SEMANTIC HIDING DATABASES_files/pink.gif" alt="_/ "><b><em>Query obfuscation:</em></b>
For frequently user issued legit queries on those unencrypted numeric data columns, the SHDB tool is designed to 
periodically send similar but false (not user issued but automatically generated) queries to those false data columns. <br> 
</dt></ol><table>

</p><p>
<b> CURRENT STATUS:</b>
</p><p>
A graduate student Andres Campossainz
has developed a prototype API, the cloud SHDB tool, which can create, load and query 
SHDB instances stored in clouds.
The API is a user friendly interface between customers and cloud database servers. 
The API is responsible of performing all underlying encryption/decryption operations. 
Thus the existence of semantic hiding database instances is transparent to
both customers and cloud database servers. <br>

The overall architecture design of the SHDB application programming interface (API)
and how the query processing works in SHDB are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 on the top of the page. 
Some snapshots of the API dialogs are shown below (click to enlarge the figures).
