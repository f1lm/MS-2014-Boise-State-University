<p>My name is Stephen A. Ridley and as you can see from the <a href="http://indysci.org/" rel="nofollow">indysci.org</a> website, I actually sit on the board of <a href="http://indysci.org/" rel="nofollow">IndySci.org</a> so I'd have to disagree with you. This is why funding is needed for clinical trials and the xenotype study. This is medicine not "old wives' remedies"</p>

<p>The question isn't necessarily how this specific endeavor is useful to human kind.  If that is as far as you can see then you have a very myopic view of not only this issue, but intellectual property in general.  The question is how can open source alleviate the stifling of ingenuity and creative gains, sometimes with life and death consequences to all industries at large, particularly in this case the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Also, how can being an absolute and complete douche-bag be useful to anything or anybody... I mean... really...?</p>

<p>Matthew, you come off as a grumpy old man with an axe to grind. Unreasonable, loud and obnoxious. If you want to engage in a meaningful discourse about the merits - or lack thereof - of this proposed 9DS research or, say, the cooperation of Debra Parcheta's computer science class, then stop shouting in all caps, stop swearing at people and come down from your high horse, calling adults "kiddo" and scoffing "which part of ... do you not grasp".</p><p>Instead, address the specific project discussed here and explain what part you disagree with and why. Instead of regurgitating big, important-sounding words like a mantra ("mutasynthesis ROULETTE"), explain what they mean and exactly how they relate to 9-DS. In a calm and reasonable tone.</p><p>I'm a layman with these things. I don't really know what is the most promising research. But I have to say if your goal is to convince "normal" people like me to refrain from supporting this research, you fail miserably.</p>

<p>Why would he NEED any such patents or rights when he KNOWS he's not going to be able to produce anything?  He's making money via viral fundraising and for that all you need is lofty promises and convincing bullshit to lure man-children like yourself into forking over gobs of cash.</p><p>He's essentially no different than a pedophile writing, "FREE CANDY" or "FREE CANCER CURE" on the side of a van... raping you in your wallet when you're dumb enough to get on board.</p><p>Oh, by the by, I DO have a sense of ethics, so while I generally don't have a problem with using stupid people to make money I *DO* have a problem with trying to exploit sick, desperate and dying people with FALSE HOPE in order to make money.  There is a HUGE difference!</p><p>...the very fact that you can't even seem to register that difference is, quite frankly, pretty alarming.  It sounds to me like you might have sociopathic tendencies.</p>

<p>I know I'm feeding the troll, or the paid agent provocateur, but I'll feed just one last time...  Don't expect any more snacks hoss.</p><p>Don't try to talk your way out of your either immature or blatantly disregarding nature of ethics.

Some 1200 of them, in fact.</p><p>The finding was stark.</p><p>Their behavior had nothing at all to do with discussions, debating, or even particularly-strongly held beliefs.</p><p>“Both trolls and sadists feel sadistic glee at the distress of others,” the report states. “Sadists just want to have fun ... and the internet is their playground.”</p><p>Trolls scored high on what are called the “Dark Tetrad” indicators: Narcissism, Machiavellanism, psychopathy and sadism.</p><p>Internet trolls ... Narcissists. Machiavellian. Psychopathic. Sadistic.</p><p>Especially sadism.</p><p>In other words, when the working day is done, making you feel bad is their kind of fun.</p><p>“Thus cyber-trolling appears to be an internet manifestation of everyday sadism,” the study finds.</p><p>The chatrooms and social media feeds are their hunting grounds. Lies, exaggerations and provocative statements are their weapons of choice.</p><p>They spend hours and hours defying logic, commonsense and courtesy for no purpose other than to inflame and upset."</p><p>Yes, defying logic, commonsense and courtesy.</p><p>I'm done feeding the troll.

<p>So you can't actually prove me wrong so instead you're putting up a lovely little strawman coupled with some personal attacks... don't worry, I wasn't expecting any better from someone of your... "height".</p><p>PS - Claiming it's 'not that bad' because it's 'only $50k'... wow... just... WOW!</p><p>I mean, apparently in Bizzaro world where you live it's okay to do things like break laws and scam people so long as it's 'only $50k'... I mean... is that like a universal cap for you, ooooor... do you maybe do "discount scamming"?  Little old ladies can only be nailed for $20k perhaps?</p><p>I know a lot of people have a pretty shifty sense of morality... but uh... I gotta say, I've never seen someone so blatantly honest about their willfulness to screw other people over for their own benefit... you know... as long as it's 'only $50k', amirite?  ;)</p>

<p>You don't know much about how that actually works in practice, do you Ridley?  I hate to break this to you, but uh... the courts in general aren't usually very favorable towards open source setups and their stuff very often winds up stolen or ripped off.</p><p>Often as the result of the source code being directly available it's VERY easy to reverse engineer and then call it something new.  In a few especially fuckheaded cases that's happened and then they turn right around and try and sue the original source they ripped off for complete control.</p><p>Things aren't so bad at this point, but uh... back in the 90s and early 2Ks it was REALLY bad.</p><p>But that's beside the point in this case since, again, they don't actually ~have~ anything so it's not like it's even a relevant concern in the least.  Not unless they're interested in marketing a new hybrid form of Parkinson's and heart disease.</p>

<p>My firm <a href="http://www.xipiter.com/" rel="nofollow">www.xipiter.com</a> actually specializes in software reverse engineering and related services such as validation of crypto and Digital Rights Management schemes. We've also served as "expert witness" on these types of cases. So yes I am very familiar. That said, it is still possible to protect intellectual property using a number of clever techniques. Such as code watermarking, obfuscation, etc. All of which we will be exploring in the biotech realm at <a href="http://www.indysci.org/" rel="nofollow">www.indysci.org</a>. Researching clever ways to build systems and schemes by which we can "open source" chemical compounds the same ways that it is done in software is exactly why we founded <a href="http://www.indysci.org/" rel="nofollow">www.indysci.org</a>. <br>Your enthusiasm is great. Join our mailinglist to continue this discourse. We look forward to talking to you and more people like you in the future!</p>
