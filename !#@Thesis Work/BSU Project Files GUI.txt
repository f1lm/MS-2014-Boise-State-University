Computer Science Masters Thesis/Project Style Files

LaTeX style files for Boise State University Masters Thesis or Project report are available here as a zip archive or via Subversion server from https://onyx/repos/thesis-project-template/trunk.  The zip file also contains a sample template named bsu-thesis-template.tex that shows you how to use the style files. Download the zip file and unzip it.  Run latex on sample file and read the sample template.

A nice GUI for using LaTeX is kile. It is available in the Linux lab on all workstations. You can install it on your Fedora Linux systems (Fedora) with the command  yum install kile (as root user). 

The CS MS style files are maintained by Amit Jain. Please contact Amit with any additional questions.

Thanks to Mike Stark for a complete rewrite in 2008 and Alex Feldman with help in maintenance.
