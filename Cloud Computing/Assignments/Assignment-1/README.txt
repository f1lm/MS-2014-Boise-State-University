I have added the both JAR and WAR file with POM.XML.

I have changed the WEbservice endpoints so please make sure the endpoints are correct, if you are testing it with browser url.

I already did complete test from my application so I would suggest to test from web application rather than from browser url typing of webservice path.

The github repo for this is: 

https://github.com/Milstein/MS-2014-Boise-State-University/tree/master/Cloud%20Computing/Assignments/SocialNetwork

The database configuration is in : SocialNetwork\src\dao\Database.java 
The project database name is: db_socialnetwork

The Base URL for the webservice is : var BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/SocialNetwork/";

so if any change in this url then the page javascript value need to be updated so I suggest to create same hosting service in same name as SocialNetwork.

All services are in this folder: \SocialNetwork\src\webservices

The Client part is exported as SocialNetwork.war

I have completed all the necessary back-end methods in JAX-RS web service but due to time constraint I am able to develop only some functionality in front/client side even thought that demonstrate the implementation of POST, GET methods using web-service and also Session to login and logout user is done. To update message/status I design the client web application with css and js.

I have done the Database design in MySQL, I have included the SQL dump file.

I have written the sql queries but their validity and verification is not fully tested at this moment. Which is left for later time!

I have tested the site using Tomcat 8.0 and all needed jar files are included on lib folder of the application. Hopefully the dependency is included in WAR file.

It was a great challenging assignment and I learnt so much about uses of JAX-RS and Servelet in JAVA application.

Thanks,
Milson
