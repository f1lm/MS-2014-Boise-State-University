<p>Varun, I think you need to distinguish between Google's end-user services and its cloud platform service level agreement. If you're not paying for something, your data is the payment. If, on the other hand, you're paying for something, the level of service and protection of data is generally better.</p>

<p>What about precedent? It's good to look at the history of such agreements. These agreements aren't static documents in the internet age. They are routinely updated and changed and while companies notify users of changes and in principle you can handle data in a way that isn't "evil", in practice that guarantee can be quite weak. You can't predict the future with 100% certainty, but you can follow trends to make reasonable predictions or at least know what you ought to watch out for. No exception here.</p>

<p>Google doesn't sell customer data, it sells the ability to target ads to its customers.  Advertisers don't get a copy of your bio, they get the ability to target an ad at "24- to 34-year-old women who like hockey." More to the point, that refers only to the customers of *Google's* consumer services, not those of any service you build on their infrastructure.  Check your ToS if you have concerns.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the quick response.  In my haste to get out a question about privacy, I failed to congratulate your team.  Everyone I've interacted with at Firebase has been immensely helpful and encouraging.  I wish you all the best and look forward to seeing the improvements y'all have planned for the service.</p><p>FYI: As you can see below, this is a pretty hot topic.  It'd put a lot of developers at ease if you could point us to a document that clearly indicates the boundaries between our data (our customer's data) and what Firebase/Google can, can't, will, and will not do with it.</p>

<p>It IS a hot topic. In Europe we have difficulties using Firebase beyond the prototyping stage, becasue the the privacy laws here require American firms to have a "safe harbour" agreement in place to guarantee adherence to our rules. Any chance you'll look into putting such an agreement in place?? Would love to stay with you guys!!!</p>

<p>Sounds great! Please let us know when it's on your roadmap. We currently use Firebase for our prototype, which works great. However, in spring 2015 we launch a new product into Swedish schools, so we'd need to know by end of year if Safe Harbor will be in place by spring. We hope so and would love to remain your customer!</p>

<p>Indeed the pricing is a little off when you are planning to stick with Firebase over a long period of the life of your application after you have devoted so much time learning a list of whole new paradigms in development. If you want to move away from Firebase it will require (almost?) a full rewrite of your application to use the other 'real time' storage you pick. So a more flexible pricing would be amazing and it would pave the way for Firebase to be the leader in how most apps are built in the future.<br>Congrats to the team btw!</p>

<p>:+1: Nice. As a custom of both Firebase and Google Cloud Platform I'm really excited to see the two work better together. I'm currently working on a near realtime synchronization feature for an mobile application and the combination of GCP + Firebase has been working great. Not sure how you'll make it better, but I suppose I'll find out Nov. 4th. :) Congrats!</p>
