<p>Nice article Paul.  As someone who works in the AI and data science space, I think you've done an admirable job capturing the zeitgeist and swell of enthusiasm toward deep learning without succumbing to the hype.  I too wonder how neural nets can bridge the gaps needed to complete AI's journey to human level cognition.  But given its recent successes, I'm reluctant to gainsay deep learning's prospects.</p>

<p>Perhaps this time around, AI will have learned its lesson about promising the moon, ending up looking foolish in the process.  The reason we use models is to simplify complex phenomena and neural network techniques provide an interesting model for handling big data.  Older AI methods based on various search algorithms inevitably run up against the reality of exponential growth of search paths through the data.  They might succeed in the task eventually, but as neatly pointed out in a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by that time no one would care any longer.  That was a lesson learned in robotics 15 years ago, exemplified by the immediate success of the Roomba vacuum using simple stimulus-response rather than deal algorithmically with the complexity of its operating environment.  Nothing helps more than having a truly successful application, which apparently is now the case for neural networks.</p>

<p>Well, if we made an equivalent comparison, and compared the results of the neural net wit the results of, say, auditory processing, the results would probably be different. Conscious cognition and prediction is a different thing. Humans can predict the results of 5th order equations IIRC, when data is presented as audible streams.</p>

<p>On a recent trip with my son and 15year old grand daughter, she asked her Dad to go out for breakfast.  I told her our hotel provided a free breakfast and it was excellent.  She smiled and calmly informed me that all her breakfasts are free.</p><p>When Dad asked where she wanted to go she said chic-fillet.  I told her that there was not one around here for miles.  She spoke into her cell phone and said, " where is the closest chic-fillet.?"  The phone answered ,1.7 miles.</p><p>What is this world coming to when you can't lie to your kids ?  AI stay away.l</p>

<p>Well, let's face it, academe is on its deathbed... it has ceased to do anything relevant.</p><p>Of course, machines can learn, of course they can perform as well as the average brain. Of course, they will keep getting closer and closer to human experience, but the difference between human and machine will remain irreducible, because the space of "getting closer" is infinitely divisible into smaller and smaller particles and differences. The closer a machine gets to the human brain, the further away it is from its "humanity" and this law is unlikely to change.</p><p>Hinton's autobiography needs work: full of platitudes... like his grandfather invented computers, yawn... everybody and their grandmother has claimed that. Now he needs someone from the humanities to come up with a better story about... himself.</p><p>90% of research produced in the academy today is denied publication -- and pay and recognition.</p>

<p>You may want to read up on your history.  His grandfather (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boole/)" rel="nofollow">http://plato.stanford.edu/entr...</a> pioneered boolean algebra, by which we can transform the manipulation of electrical signals into meaningful logic.  If that isn't fundamental to computing, I don't know what is.  So it doesn't matter that "everybody and their grandmother has claimed that."  When you and your grandmother claim it, it isn't true.  When he claims it, it is.</p><p>I love your comment on how humans and computers become further apart the closer together they are.  Take a set with infinitely many members A and a set with infinitely many members B, where A and B are not the same set.  Furthermore, there is more than one member of A which is not in B, and more than one member of B which is not in A.  Now let's create a set C.  We create it by taking A, and changing one of its members which is not in B to be one of the members of B which is not in A.  We would then be able to say that C is nearer to being equal to B than A, since it has one more member which is shared with B than A does.</p><p>So no, being able to split things into infinitely many parts does not mean that things become less similar to each other the more similar to each other they become.  That would be stupid.</p>

<p>I think the point is that while Voosen was tired and therefore his biological circuits weren't firing at peak efficiency. The machine was not tired, and continued to work along at its steady level. In this case, since the machine was in learning mode, it was getting better at the recognition task just as Voosen was getting worse. Admitting that machines are better at something than humans are - in this case, indefinitely sustained algorithmic learning - is hardly a confession; we've known this since the days of John Henry. That doesn't either exalt the machine or devalue humanity; it's just a matter of fact and hardly something worth an act of contrition or even a plenary indulgence.</p>

<p>"infallible" is somewhat different from "widespread enough and solid enough to be worth noticing." While anthropogenic climate change certainly doesn't rise to the former standard, it probably meets the latter standard nicely. Whenever you manage to get 90% or more general consensus on the part of qualified scientists on any particular issue, it's unlikely to be just convenient politics; there is likely some serious substance there, worth attending to.</p>

<p>You're bandying words. A huge element of the anthropogenic climate change argument continues to be, "but everybody says so." Science has been full of such moments of consensus that turned out to be wrong. This article touches on a similar situation in a different field, except in this case, the doubter -- shall we call him the "denier" just for fun? -- happens to be portrayed as the good guy.</p>

<p>Shame on you. To write about ANN without mentioning Paul Werbos, whose 1973 PhD thesis was the first one to use the back-propagation algorithm, which was ignored (who reads PhD thesa?) until re-invented by Rumelhart in 1985.</p><p>Werbos, P.J. (1994), The Roots of Backpropagation, NY:<br>John Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN: 0471598976. Includes Werbos's 1974 Harvard Ph.D.<br>thesis, Beyond Regression</p>

<p>It is absolutely the case that Paul Werbos invented a version of backprop more than a decade before the PDP group published, though in a different context: as a method "for estimating a dynamic model to predict nationalism and social communications," as Werbos later put it.</p><p>Others also separately invented their own version of backprop concurrently or just before PDP: David Parker and, notably, Yann LeCun. As LeCun also pointed out to me, optimal control theory had used algorithms very close to backprop since the 1960s. Good inventions rarely come once.</p><p>I wish I could have included this context in the story, but not everything makes it in, unfortunately. Others I would have loved to mention: Andrew Ng, now at Baidu, so influential in getting Google to adopt DL and generous in talking with me; John Hopfield, who galvanized so many physicists to investigate neural nets in the 1980s; Kunihiko Fukushima's work on the cognitron; Hubel and Wiesel’s work on the visual cortex, and its importance to Fukushima and LeCun's convolutional neural nets; and the many grad students and postdocs in Hinton's lab and others who have contributed to the third resurgence.</p>
