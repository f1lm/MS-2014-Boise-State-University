Organizations see the elimination of paper as an area that can yield an immediate return on investment (ROI). Heavily paper-based business processes provide some of the best opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency increases. Information capture can play an integral part in the optimization of business processes, as it speeds the conversion of unstructured information - whether that information is found on paper, in email and fax communications, and in PDF and XML files feeding operational systems. Information capture automatically groups and extracts business-critical information from incoming transactional documents and improves the integration with back-end systems and business processes. Information capture will reduce the amount of paper an organization will handle in the course a normal business day. <br/><br/>In April 2012, IBM commissioned Forrester Consulting to examine the total economic impact (TEI) and potential ROI that enterprises might realize by deploying IBM's Datacap Taskmaster Capture solution.
