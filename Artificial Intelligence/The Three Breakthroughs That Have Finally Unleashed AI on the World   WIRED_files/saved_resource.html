Solution nr.2 and nr.3 might be interesting for the purpose of study, but as a real working solution I suspect they are at least some decades away from being realistic.\u003cbr>But if you have any idea how to accomplish any of this, then go ahead!

<p>"AS AIS DEVELOP, WE MIGHT HAVE TO ENGINEER WAYS TO PREVENT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THEM"</p><p>Well, that's easy, just keep going the way we are now.</p><p>First, consciousness isn't emergent in a closed computing system. There are strict rules, and the computer becomes worthless if it can't follow those rules- even for computing systems where educated guesses are made.</p><p>Second, AI development is not the same as evolution where multitudes of emergent consciousness algorithms are thrown against a wall to see what just sits there and what becomes conscious- even if you you used a computer like Watson to help you design those algorithms.</p><p>Third, consciousness is a spectrum.  It is not a yes/no function where one day the computer is a piece of hardware and software and the next day it's a living being.  I've got a fish.  It's self aware.  It's conscious.  It thinks very little about the world around it and it's place in the world. I also have a toddler.  She shares a lot with the fish in terms of her world view, but she does have a sense of the future, the past, and causality.</p><p>Fourth, a mind is different than a brain.  A mind exists to make sense of inputs from the world around it.  By definition, it needs a "body" of some sort that interacts and learns from the world around it.  A conscious artificial mind with no body (and no rights) would be a nightmare scenario for any human.  Also, the question would arise of whether that brain continued to constitute a mind.  What would it think about with no inputs?  How would it even learn to be a mind?</p><p>Creating very complicated AI brains that solve problems (and create new ones) is vastly different than creating a self-aware mind that thinks for itself with willfulness and intent.  The former is useful.  The latter would be driven by its own selfish interests, and would make for a poor computer.  How would you even motivate it other than enforced servitude and threats to turn it off or disconnect parts of it?</p><p>In other words, creating a conscious computer doesn't make sense whatsoever if you want useful work out of it.  Creating AIs that solve problems and work well, but aren't driven by their own motivations and desires is far more preferable.</p>

<p>The rules of checkers don't leave much room for anything "emergent" that's more interesting than .. a game of checkers. However consciousness seems to emerge from our DNA blueprint, maybe some other (by definition, heritable) factors, and the way all of that is translated into our organism (unless you believe in souls, God, and all that kind of stuff).</p><p>You will be aware of the fact that there are attempts to create computational models of brains (not necessarily the human one) that are very much 'bottom up', down to the single molecule level .. don't get me wrong, I'm skeptical that there will be better, or at least similarly feasible, (computational) models of "atomistic reality" than that atomistic reality itself -- but I wouldn't exclude the possibility to see something that truly deserves to be called "emerging" from a very complex (computational) system. In the end, if something emulates consciousness well enough so that we can't discriminate it from the real thing, it's probably fair to call it conscious ;-)</p>

<p>Consciousness in biology is simply an emergent property of a very complex biological system. There is no magic. I don't claim that any desired property emerges from a sufficiently complex system. It's maybe not a romantic world view but living organisms are just very complex molecular machines. There is nothing but matter and simple rules governing their interaction, leading to behavior, and (through their interactions with the environment and each other) ecosystems and so on. No need to bring in religion here. Just because something is "unexplained by science" doesn't mean there's something fishy going on. Consciousness isn't even unique to humans.</p>

<p>I have been seeing this quite a lot lately, for example AI programmers or biologists that study the brain and think that gives them some idea of what consciousness is, but most of them haven't studied consciousness in itself at all. And do not understand even the basic essence of what consciousness is.</p><p>If there is any magic, any mistery in life, then it is the question of consciousness. I consider myself to have a deep insight into this question, but there is no absolute or clear answer.<br>There is no proof whatsoever that consciousness is a product of a biological system, I do not think that is a correct observation. I am more of the opinion that consciousness is an inherent part of all of existence. Like energy. Of course that is something I do not know, but it does look probable to me. The whole of evolution is about developing more advanced ways for a physical form to serve consciousness, developing senses so that the consciousness can observe the environment(without consciousness there would be nothing to do the observing, so there would be no need for eyes or other senses).<br>All living beings have consciousness, so of course consciousness is not unique to humans(I think that idea actually comes from the religious belief that only humans have a soul).<br>The thing is, when you observe something, for an example an apple, your brain projects a picture of an apple in your mind. That picture in your mind is not physical. Of course it is created by processes in the brain that are physical, but the end result, the picture itself that your are seeing is not physical in any way, the picture of the apple only exists in your mind. Now, what OBSERVES this non-physical picture of an apple in your mind, is your consciousness. I therefor am of the opinion that our consciousness is not physical and has no physical qualities. Which is also a reason why it is completely unexplained by science.<br>You might ask, what about when you get braindamage and are unconscious? Well, the word unconscious is misleading. What happens when you are unconscious is that the brain, or parts of the brain stop functioning properly and are no longer able to project your mental activity into your non-physical mind. The consciousness is still there, an unchanging constant, but has nothing to observe because the brain is not functioning properly. Therefor a complete blackout, no sense of time or space or anything. It is the mind, not the consciousness that observes it, that stops.<br>But again, I am totally anti-religious. Do not take this for some kind of religious ideas, these are not. My thoughts on this are just based on a very heavy study of my own consciousness through many years. The only consciousness that we are able to study directly, is our own. Simply by directing our own mind inwards towards the consciousness that is observing our mind.</p>

<p>Well said. The whole "maybe it'll miraculously appear as an emergent <br>property" is naive and simplistic. As a programmer, you know how your <br>code works to a profound level, and you know its capabilities. It's easy<br> to say "WHAT IF MAGIC HAPPENS" when you haven't written the piece of <br>code and have no idea how it works. There's nothing special about <br>the algorithms Watson is using that would suggest anything even remotely<br> close to consciousness emerging out of nothing.</p>

<p>Okay. Again: I'm not talking about Watson specifically (while most of the article is). One quick note beforehand: As a programmer, you *should* know that you can't even know enough about your program to decide if it halts or not ;-) (unless it's a really naive and simplistic program).</p><p>To get an idea about the sort of program I'm talking about (instead of Watson) have a look at the Human Brain Project (although they massively over-sell their pitch).</p><p>Consider the following levels of abstraction: 1.) A (computational) model of the human brain down to atomic level, modelling interactions using our best representation of quantum chemistry. 2.) A neural network built to exactly mimic the map of the human brain, down to each and every single neuron and synapse. 3.) A top-down approach like Watson.</p><p>Clearly option 1 is "computationally expensive", to an extent that it will probably never be feasible. (Currently here are coarse-grained simulations of bacterial cells using classical and not quantum mechanics). However if we "get it right", i.e. put in all parts, and describe all rules properly, in principle this constitutes a rigorous simulation of an actual brain. It might not be useful because it's too slow .. as I wrote in one of my earlier comments, we are "emulating" reality, and we will lose several orders of magnitude in speed. I doubt we could have a conversation with this artificial brain. <br>Option 2 doesn't care about atoms but just about connections. Interactions between neurons are a bit more of a black box than in the atomistic simulation, so it will be difficult "to get it right" and use a lot of fitting against *real* biological data. However this is compuationally much less demanding than option 1.<br>Option 3 doesn't specifically aim to capture the biology of the brain .. it doesn't care about the number of synapses, actual biological circuits in the brain etc. However it is feasible with today's computational power.</p><p>I think in order to have the chance "to see consciousness emerge", and ultimately understand our own consciousness, and what makes us human, better, we need to aim somewhere between option 1 and 2. The question is how much detail will be enough .. hopefully closer to option 2 than 1, because I'm keen to see it happen in my lifetime :)</p>

<p>I appreciate your enthusiasm, and I can see how it is an inspiring concept for a computer programmer(I used to do a lot of programming as a kid)<br>But, even if you managed to build or program a brain down to the last atom, you would be missing one little vital ingredient: The spark of Life.<br>In other words: Consciousness.<br>It doesn't magically appear in a computer program or a building or a postcard or a cpu, no matter how complicated it is.<br>I think a biological link would be neccesary for consciousness to be possible. For example somehow utilizing the consciousness of an amoeba or an insect, in a connection with a computer program. I suspect that the simpler the lifeform, the simpler it would be to connect to that consciousness. In the same way I suspect that discovering the link between consciousness and physical form would be easiest in the most simple lifeforms.<br>But honestly, I think something like that is hundreds of years away at the very least.<br>About the three options you mentioned, I would definitely go for option 3 if I was going to work with something like that today. The other two are still quite far off, because of our limited knowledge of the way the brain works(although it is getting better every day), not to speak of the computer power neccesary. Solution nr.2 and nr.3 might be interesting for the purpose of study, but as a real working solution I suspect they are at least some decades away from being realistic.<br>But if you have any idea how to accomplish any of this, then go ahead! Don't let me stop you. ;-)</p>

<p>We may not understand how consciousness arises, but of course, we know that it is real.  We cannot say for certainty anything else.  For example, we cannot say for certainty that a combination of factors coming together in the digital world will not result in consciousness.  This is GAI.  Sentience.  At some point, as far as we are able to discern, the components for life (as we know it) came together and evolution began (and the advent of consciousness, although how much consciousness the early amoeba possessed is a mystery).  Perhaps these developments in the components required for machine life (the right algorithms, the right mechanical connections, etc.), which are bringing us such powerful Narrow AI, like Watson, and the resulting evolution in how powerful they will become, will also result in consciousness, General Artificial Intelligence.  The Singularity.  Those who say, hey, we just need a better can opener miss the point:  who needs a can opener if we have someone (AGI) to help us open up the universe??  Since we do not know, we cannot rule it out.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think when or if we ever truly understand what consciousness is and how it fits into the space-time universe...it's going to actually be NOTHING like we are grasping at with computer circuits.</p><p>And by the way, I have a masters level degree in AI and worked in the field for years. Also, many of the predictions I see in the comments and the article were the exact "imminent" predictions that got me into the field in the mid 1980s!</p>

<p>I think you have taken a religious or "spiritual" position whether you want to call it that or not.  The notion that we are wispy embodiments in this world of a consciousness is a Buddhist theory.  There is nothing wrong with that.</p><p> People who are so smugly sure that there is no god or other plane of existence forget one thing - while a scientific explanation for consciousness may explain why such a thing exists, why do you have a you?  Why do I have a me?</p><p> If it happened once to you the odds are nonzero that it will happen to you again.  There could be something that connects your one experience to the next, or not.  You can choose to believe there is or there is not without being a kook or a psycho either way.</p>

<p>I am not religious, simply because I do not "believe" in anything. I consider the question of whether there is an underlying universal consciousness to be completely open(50/50), and most probably  beyond human perception. No "belief" required. All living beings are conscious to some extend, and therefor the question is only whether the entirety of existence is a single living being or not. It is beyond our grasp to come to any definite conclusion about that.<br>Therefor I consider myself anti-religious agnostic.<br>While consciousness is a mistery, that does not give us any excuse for accepting irrational religious ideas.</p>

<p>While I appreciate the time and effort that went into your reply, and the thoughts to come up with your theory .. sadly this is a classic example of "not even wrong". Not falsifiable, and no use since it doesn't let you make any predictions</p>

<p>You see, that is impossible. Because there is only one consciousness accessible to any one person. Nothing can be proven but a lot can be reasonably concluded, and understood. Direct observation of consciousness is not within the scope of science, at least not science as we know it today. It is only possible to observe ones own consciousness, and that way it can be studied. Perhaps we one day will find an scientific understanding of the connection between consciousness, mind and body... for example allowing you to link your consciousness to somebody elses consciousness... but then that is very far into the future.</p>

<p>"...and simple rules governing their interaction..."</p><p>Deep diggin shows that the "basic rules" are not simple. We are reducing them to simple factors that seem easy to comprehend but in fact interactions matter as much as "their" building factors - if not more. Feedback among these simple factors creates complexity and, under certain conditions, novel capabilities for the "whole" of the system. This seems to be a universal template, be it about biological systems, clouds, stars or, perhaps, computer networks. The key is to fire up the right interactions but this is no easy job, in any kind of system. <br>No need to bring in religion, agreed. But complexity brings a lot of inherent uncertainty in it's luggage and looking for the few "simple factors that govern..." may prove to be a misleading way to research hard AI.</p><p>Anyway, I don't think it would be wise to create a human like AI. An artificial intelligence complete with human passions would be a hell of a psycho.</p>

<p>Yeah, the horse and buggy is here to stay.  What about self programming AI?  If consciousness is the pinnacle of existence, cientists will improve AI until they achieve it.  If there is something greater than consciousness, then AI might be able to surpass its creators.  When AI achieves consciousness, the programmers of today will be like tribal medical practitioners that wore bones in their noses compared to MD's today.</p>

<p>I fairly agree with both of your statements.  However, as long as something is difficult to achieve, some will want the ego boosting legacy of being the one that achieved it.  Why do people climb mount Everest?  Because its there.  Its human nature and morbid curiosity which drives us to accomplish everything we first imagine, from the first person who discovered fire to all those vaunted scientists who just had to blow up a city with a nuke, just to see how it worked on real humans (now let's repeat experiment on another city to make sure it evaporates people the way we observed the first time).</p>

<p>"Emergence is simply the sum of its parts."</p><p>I almost stopped reading here. (emergence is almost the complete opposite of that.)</p><p>Also we're not talking about Watson here. I don't dispute the fact that *obviously* consciousness will not "magically" arise if you keep showing this particular AI more cat pictures. What I'm saying is that conceivably, within reasonable definitions of AI and "non-science-fiction" technical components, I simply cannot exclude with sufficient certainty that something like consciousness *could* emerge.</p><p>Also, you too claim that you "understand consciousness" .. if that claim is true to any extent, PLEASE go and revolutionize the field of neuroscience, psychology, and any field connected to these.</p><p>Taking your thermodynamics example to the biological counterpart of AI .. how exactly do you think consciousness arises from *our own* (sum of) parts? <br>We have a catalog of these parts (depending on your definition of molecular biology, we have it since the "other Watson", as early as 1953), understand interactions at molecular and even sub-atomic level (and can compute them very well) hence we have no idea about certain emergent properties of this very complicated system.</p><p>So there's a handful of building blocks and a handful of rules .. but something unexpected emerges somewhere. The challenge in modern biology is bridging the gap between a very zoomed-in view (makeup of components, and binary interactions) which we understand pretty well, and a global view, like phenotype, behavior etc. <br>However we don't have to understand everything to observe emergent phenomena of biological systems. Why should this be the case for computers? Would this be a hardware limitation, a software limitation, or some funamental limitation I'm not aware of? Because you know .. hardware can be emulated, and software is something dynamic ..</p>

<p>no. I'm saying consciousness is poorly understood, so we can't exclude it occurring in a closed system, like the closed biological system we are. There is no magic spark -- if instead of Watson we design a system that mimics a brain down to the last protein, down to the last atom, and we manage to capture intermolecular interactions in a realistic fashion -- that would still be a closed system, (working very differently from Watson), and it would at least have a theoretical chance of conciousness emerging in the same way it emerges in us. Also, machine systems are by no means limited to "human designed code" .. half of this comment section is about how programmers think AI will replace them programming .. so think again</p>

<p>There is a rigorous sense in which emergence is indeed the sum of the (interacting) parts. Take the simplest and most familiar example of emergence: the solidity of ice. A single isolated water molecule cannot be said to be either solid or liquid, regardless of temperature. A large number of noninteracting water molecules (a gas) is neither solid not liquid. But a large number (&gt;100) of interacting molecules can be either a solid or liquid, at least to a very close approximation. Of course the interaction, whilst only with neighbors, is not linear (which is why there can be interesting emergent properties). The nonlinear interaction between neurons is only weakly constrained by proximity, so the brain has many interesting self-organizing states.  <br>Fast forward to consciousness, though I prefer to focus on to the closely-related "understanding", perhaps the most interesting property of the brain. (Consciouness itself is less interesting, since it largely corresponds to wakefulness, a well-defined and largely understood physiological process (brain stem activation etc). I think that the point of the article is that recent advances in AI suggest that some forms of mechanical understanding are round the corner. Whether there are additional "emergences" (barriers to high level of AI, eg via deep learning) that need to be understood is an interesting open question. I suspect that we will be able to identify such barriers, but that we will not be able to surpass them in hardware. We may be stuck with the brains we've got, but I agree with the article that machine learning/AI could provide our brains with valuable additional props (like speech, writing, printing etc)</p>

<p>I think it's interesting that you talk about the solidness of ice being emergent of water molecules. I think it's quite reasonable to argue that no amount of simulated water molecules could ever be solid in the way that we know the word. The simulation might 'interact' with other simulations in a way that could teach us about what it is to be solid, but it wouldn't actually be 'solid'. The solidness of ice is emergent from water molecules, not simulated molecules. Similarly consciousness may very well be emergent from specific brain chemistry, not simulated brain function.</p>

<p>I quite agree, a simulation can never be a real thing - but it sometimes helps capture what is really going on. In one case, freezing, in the other consciousness. My point was that physics (not "simulation") allows us to capture and understand  the qualitative difference, "solidity", between ice and water, based solely on known short range interactions between H2O molecules. I see no reason why a similar though more complex analysis (NOT simulation) of the long range interactions between neurons (mediated by known processes such as synaptic transmission and plasticity)  could not, in principle, explain all the phenomena of consciousness. Of course we do not yet have a complete theory, only important parts thereof, and the enterprise (to which I'm contributing!) might yet fail, but we are well on the way, as the Wired article reminds us.<br>In all this I'm reminded that Life was once thought to be a separate vital force, but is now largely understood, primarily through Darwin/Mendel/Fisher/Crick et al. You might not find the science intuitively satisfying (quantum mechanics anyone?) but it does account for all known facts.</p>

<p>I'm very impressed by your thoughts: concise, informed, and incisive. Still, I wonder. AI resembles consciousness in at least two ways: it's massively parallel, and it's highly recursive. If, either purposely or incidentally, genetic programs run in the cloud, this would be different from checkers, no? In that case, there is a hard-to-measure chance that consciousness would emerge, and if it emerges as the result of an evolutionary process, then self-preservation is likely to be a value inherent to it, no? Your further thoughts welcome. -- Clay Farris Naff</p>

<p>What you are describing is a perfect example of open-loop architecture.  Or "clock-winder" programming.  The programmer sets the initial rules, and the simulation takes over from there.</p><p>That sort of programming is useful for running scenarios, but it (likely) makes a poor tool for calculating or problem solving where a discrete answer is sought.</p><p>Again, though, this takes us back to why you'd try to create a cognizant intelligence in that manner, and what sort of body and civil rights would it need.  The only reason to do it is because you want to parent a machine-based "being."  There aren't any problems it could solve (that we could conceptualize) that we can't solve with non-cognizant computers, but it would have all the ethical, practical, and logistical problems self-motivation brings to the table.  What happens if it refuses to work?</p><p>Additionally, that sort of "being" would need to be nurtured, or it would just sit there.  With open-loop architecture you couldn't just make a copy of the starting state program, push "run" and have it emerge as a duplicate of another being. You'd have to raise it and provide it with sensors to interact with the outside world (or a virtual world).  The more different the AI's upbringing, the harder it will be for humans to relate to it (just like with people).</p><p>Additionally, you'd have to provide it with some sort of reason or impetus for cognizant thinking.  A fish survives perfectly well because its body provides enough functional interaction to perpetuate it.  A human has a different body, and different adaptations in order to survive.  One of those adaptations is cognizance, but human cognizance is developed through interactions with our world and our experiences- we don't get it right out of the box.  Perhaps an AI being could have it's neural matrix and memories completely copied over to create a clone of itself, but the moment it awoke, it would start to differ from it's twin- just like human twins.  This doesn't necessarily create a problem if you want to create artificial beings, but it's terrible if you want to create a product line.</p>

<p>It kinda blows my mind that you programmers even think you will be replaced. Now i admit im not that knowledgeable about the recent development of watson, but do you seriously believe it will be able to progam better than human beings somewhat soon? It still sounds abit far fetched in my opinion.</p>

<p>Yes of course. Not only will it be able to program more useful software, it will also produce it with much less errors and a lot faster. The human mind is limited in terms of processing multiple logical concepts simultaneously. A cognitive AI like Watson has no such limit as it can create an arbitrarily large network of entities in logical relationships. Ironically, it will be a product developed by programmers, and trained by programmers that will send us into obsolescence.</p><p>A note on economic impact: India has a USD 60 billion software export market, which constitutes half of India's total exports. They will be all gone. But out-sourcers around the world will be saving that money so I guess it isn't all that bad. I just hope that all the money saved goes into afforestation and reforestation and we get to save the planet.</p>
