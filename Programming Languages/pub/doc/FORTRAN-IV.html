<h3><b>Program Organization</b></h3>

All FORTRAN programs have the following format:

    PROGRAM statement
    variable declarations (optional)
    executable statements
    END statement
    SUBROUTINE or FUNCTION modules (optional)
   
The original FORTRAN programs were prepared on a <a href="keypunch.html">keypunch</a> machine which punched holes into paper
cards which had 80 characters maximum.  For this reason, lines in a FORTRAN program are often 
referred to as "cards."  Each card is either a "data" card, a "comment" card or a "statement" card.

</pre>
<center><img height=180 width=417 src="punchcard.jpg"></center>
<pre>
    
<i>Data Cards</i>
All 80 characters of the line are used for program data as defined below.
    
<i>Comment Cards</i>
The first character on the card much be C; all other characters are ignored in subsequent 
processing.
   
<i>Statement Cards</i>
Statement cards are subdivided into four sections as follows:


                   1         2         3         4         5         6         7            8
    12345 | 6 | 789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012 | 34567890

<ul>   
<li>The first five characters are used for unique statement numbers.  Numbers do not need
to appear in sequence.  Any statement (except the END statement) may have a statement
number.
<li>The sixth character is called the "continuation" character.  If more space is required
from the previous card, include any character (except 0) in the 6th position of the next card.
<li>Positions 7-72 are used for the actual program code.  Often programmers use a TAB (8 spaces) 
rather than type 7 spaces.
<li>Positions 73-80 are infrequently used, but when they are they are used for identification
codes which are only of interest to the programmer, they are not computed. 
</ul>

<h3><b>Character set</b></h3>
(ASA Standard FORTRAN IV)

    A .. Z
    0 .. 9
    =
    +
    -
    *
    /
    (
    )
    ,
    .
    $ 

Note: All modern versions of FORTRAN support more characters than these.
<br><br><hr>
<h3><b>Identifiers</b></h3>    
While FORTRAN is very picky about the placement of certain program elements on a card, it is
supremely disinterested otherwise.  For example, the keyword PROGRAM, which begins a FORTRAN
program, may be typed,

    PROGRAM
    PRO GRAM
    PR OG RAM
    
or even,

    P R  O    G     R      A       M
    
This is partly due to the difficulty in repairing a typographical error when using a keypunch
machine.  Likewise, whitespace is not required between syntactic objects in a program.  In other
words the FORTRAN executable statement,

    DO 30 I = 10, 100

can also be written,

    DO30I=10,100
    
Such forms can lead to serious errors.  Imagine, for example, what would have occurred if the
programmer accidentally punched a decimal point instead of a comma in the compressed example 
above.
<br><br><hr>
<h3><b>Reserved words</b></h3>    
FORTRAN has no reserved words.  All words have meaning based on context.  For example, the 
following is legal, though unwise, in FORTRAN

    IF (IF.EQ.THEN) IF=IF*THEN

where the first use of the word IF refers to the keyword for a selection control structure,
while the other uses refer to a variable named IF; likewise, THEN is used in the context
of a variable in this statement.
<br><br><hr>
<h3><b>Data types and Variables</b></h3>
    
    <b>Variable declaration</b>
  
    Variables are named through user-defined identifiers; however, they do not need to be 
    explicitly declared in a FORTRAN program.  Variables are declared either implicitly, by use 
    of the variable's name or explicitly through a "type" statements, either DATA or DIMENSION.
             
    Any variable beginning with the letters I .. N is implicitly declared to
    be an INTEGER data type (see below) unless overridden by an explicit 
    declaration.  All other variables are implicitly declared to be REAL data
    type (see below) unless overridden.       
     
    Declaration statements require type name, followed by list of identifiers, for example:
	 		            
        INTEGER DAY,WEEK,MONTH
        REAL IM67,QU45
        LOGICAL DONE

            <b>User-defined</b>
 		    
                 FORTRAN IV does not support the creation of a user-defined data type
 		    
            <b>Structured Data</b>
 		    
            <i>Arrays</i>
            
                Arrays are created with DIMENSION statements and may have 1 to 7 subscripts 
                (depending upon implementation.  
                
                    DIMENSION W(1000)
                    DIMENSION X(10,10)
                    DIMENSION Z(4,6,8,10)
                
                or
                
                    DIMENSION W(1000),X(10,10),Z(4,6,8,10)
                
                Note that the variable arrays above will contain REAL data because no explicit 
                data type was declared.  To explicitly declare the type of value in the array use 
                the form, for example,
                
                    DOUBLE PRECISION A,K,M(5,5,10),X
                    
                which will create three unstructured double precision variables (A, K and X) as 
                well as an array of 250 double precision values (M).       
                
                FORTRAN stores arrays in column-major order meaning that the earlier subscripts 
                vary most rapidly in the actual stored data.  For example, X(1,2) is followed in 
                memory  by X(2,2) not X(1,3).  Alternately, values can be referenced by variable 
                subscripts such as X(K) or X(K+1); note the use of an integer variable subscript.               
 		    
            <i>Records</i>
            
                FORTRAN IV does not support record structures.
                
            <b>Variable initialization</b>
            
                DATA statements are used to initialize variables.  Data statements begin with the 
                keyword DATA and are followed by identifiers and values, delimited by slashes.  
                For example, either
                
                    DATA I,J,K/0,0,0/
                    
                or
                
                    DATA I,J,K/3*0/
                    
                results in the following:
                    
                    <table cellpadding=10 align=center>

                    DIMENSION L(2,3)
                    DATA L/1,2,3,4,5,6/
                    
                results in

                     </table>
                     
                Note that L is implicitly an array of integers.  Also, notice the
                effect of column-major order.

<h3><b>Assignment Statements</b></h3>

    Assignments are made as follows,
    
        <i>variable</i> = <i>expression</i>
        
    where the variable is either implicitly or explicitly declared and the expression is either a 
    literal value (e.g. T=42.) or a computed value (e.g. I=K+L), as described below.

           10./4 evaluates to 2.5

            <b>Type conversion and coercions</b>
            
            In general, mixed mode math is discouraged in FORTRAN.  When using operands with 
            different types, automatic conversion occur as follows:
            
                if any operand is COMPLEX, result is COMPLEX
                else
                    if any operand is DOUBLE PRECISION, result is DOUBLE PRECISION
                    else
                        if any operand is REAL, result is REAL
                        else
                            result is INTEGER
                        
            To convert from one data type to another explicitly, many built-in functions are 
            provided.  For example,

        <b>Character</b>
 
        No character manipulations were possible in FORTRAN IV; however, FORTRAN 77 included
        many of these useful features.
        
        <b>Function call</b>
        
        FORTRAN's many built-in functions evaluate as expressions.  User-defined functions (see
        below) likewise are called as expressions.  Below are some of the more commonly used 
        functions of FORTRAN IV.

<h3><b>Control Statements</b></h3>
  
    <b>Branch</b>
     
    GO TO 1005                  ;   unconditional branch 
                                    go directly to statement number 1005
                                    
    GO TO K                     ;   assigned branch

    GO TO (10,20,1000,20),K     ;   computed branch
                                    K=1, 2, 3 or 4 branches to statement number 10, 20, 1000 or 20
                                    
    <b>Selection</b>
    
    <i>Logical IF</i>
    
        IF (logical-expression) any valid statement <i>except</i> DO or IF
    
    Evaluate the expression, then execute the statement only if the logical-expression
    was .TRUE.  For example,
    
        IF (X.GT.T*Z) Y=X/FLOAT(K)
    
    <i>Arithmetic IF</i>
    
        IF (numeric-expression) statement1,statement2,statement3
   
    Evaluate the expression, then transfer to statement1 if the result is negative, to
    statement2 if zero, to statement3 if positive.  For example,
    
        IF (X/Y*Z) 100,300,50
        
    If the result of the computation is negative, transfer to statement number 100, if zero
    transfer to statement number 300, if positive to statement number 50.  Note that easrly
    FORTRAN had no block structure like the familiar { ... } or BEGIN ... END found
    in many other languages.  Block structure can be simulated as follows, using a 
    Java-like snippet for comparison.

    <b>Repetition</b>
  
    <i>Regular DO</i>
    
        DO statement#  variable = initialValue, finalValue, optionalIncrement
        
    Do this statement and all other statements upto the card labelled with statement#, beginning
    by setting the variable to the initialValue, then incrementing by adding 1 (or the
    non-negative optional increment value) with each successive iteration until 
    variable > finalValue.  Once the loop is finished, proceed to the next card 
    beyond the labelled statement#.
    
    Note:  Branching out of a DO loop body is allowed, but branching in is not.
           Post-test loop; always executed at least once.

    <i>Nested DO</i>
    
    Unlike the IF statement, FORTRAN allows nesting of any number of DO loops within one
    another.  The general form of a nested loop is,
    
                  DO stmt#1 variable1 = start, finish, step
                  .
                  .
                  .
                      DO stmt#2 variable2 = start, finish, step
                      .
                      .
                      .
           stmt#2     CONTINUE
                  .
                  .
           stmt#1 CONTINUE

<h3><b>Modularity</b></h3>
    
    <b>Functions</b>
    
    Functions may be used anywhere that an expression is expected in a FORTRAN program.
    As described above, a large number of functions are provided in the standard FORTRAN
    library.  These built-in functions are referred to as <i>intrinsic functions</i>.
                 
        <b>User-defined</b>
    
        Modern versions of FORTRAN have a much broader collection.  Many books have
        been published with useful FORTRAN functions which are not available in the standard
        library. The programmer implements functions using the syntax,
        
            <i>optResultType</i> FUNCTION <i>name</i>(<i>formalParamList</i>) 
            <i>optFormalParameterDeclaration</i>
            <i>optLocalVarDeclaration</i>
            <i>executableStatements</i>
            <i>name</i> = <i>value</i>
            RETURN
            END
        
        for example,
        
                PROGRAM DEMO
                .
                .
                .
                IF (CMPVAL(M1,M2,M3)) GOTO 500
                .
                .
                .
                END
          C     -------- END OF PROGRAM -------    
                LOGICAL FUNCTION CMPVAL(I,J,K)
                INTEGER SUM, HLFSUM
                LOGICAL RESULT
                SUM = I+J+K
                HLFSUM = SUM/2
                RESULT=(I.GT.HLFSUM).OR.(J.GT.HLFSUM).OR.(K.GT.HLFSUM)
                CMPVAL=RESULT
                RETURN
                END
          C     -------- END OF FUNCTION -------    

        
         
    <b>Subroutines</b> 
    
    When a programmer needs to build a module which returns either 0 or more than 1 result,
    a subroutine is used, rather than a function.  Form of the subroutine is similar to the 
    function,
    
        SUBROUTINE <i>name</i>(<i>formalParamList</i>)  
        <i>optFormalParameterDeclaration</i>
        <i>optLocalVarDeclaration</i>
        <i>executableStatements</i>
        RETURN
        END

    A subroutine receives values from the caller through the parameter list; likewise, the
    subroutine returns values by modifying the variables in the parameter list.  Subroutines 
    are invoked in a FORTRAN program as a statement, not an expression.  The syntax used is,
    
        CALL <i>name</i>(<i>actualParamList</i>)

    <b>General Limitations</b>
    
        0. Early versions of FORTRAN did not allow recursive function calls.
        
        1. The names chosen for the formal parameters <i>must</i> agree in type with the actual 
        parameters which will be passed or the data will be coerced to the new type.
        
        2. Use of global variables is not allowed without use of a COMMON statement (discussed
        in references).
        
        3.  Subroutines and functions can be thought of as totally separate program units.  For
        example, statement numbers which were used in the main program can be reused in the 
        subprograms.

<h3><b>Input/Output Statements</b></h3>

    <b>Data Formats</b>
    
    Due to the nature of the original keypunched FORTRAN, data is highly formatted in a
    FORTRAN program.  Consider, for example, a program that needs to process 4 three-digit
    integers, a real number, 2 characters, separated by a space and a six-digit integer.
    
    For example,
</pre><p>              
    <table align=center><tr><td><img src="inputFields.jpg" align=right></td></tr></table>
<p><pre>   
        
    <b>Input of formatted data</b>
    
    FORTRAN has several codes used to describe different types of data.  For example,
<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER CELLPADDING=5>
<tr><td><pre>

       I/O code    Data type for I/O
         I<i>w</i>          INTEGER
         F<i>w</i>.<i>d</i>        REAL 
         E<i>w</i>.<i>d</i>        REAL data in exponential form
         D<i>w</i>.<i>d</i>        DOUBLE PRECISION 
         A<i>w</i>          ALPHAMERIC (character)
         <i>w</i>X          space
</pre></td></tr>
</table>             
        
    where <i>w</i> refers to the total width of the field of data in characters and <i>d</i> refers 
    to the number of digits after the decimal point.  Input is handled through the use of 
    numbered FORMAT statements.  For example, to read the data above, one might use,
    
        333    FORMAT(I4,I4,I4,F8.5,A1,1X,A1,I6)
        
    or, alternately,
    
        333    FORMAT(3I4,F8.5,A1,1X,A1,I6)
    
    along with a READ statement,
    
        READ(<i>unit</i>,<i>formatStmtNumber</i>) <i>variableList</i>
        
    where unit is the integer associated with the input device.  Standard input device units 
    are machine specific and might be, for example,
    
        2    magnetic tape
        5    keyboard
        6    console display
        8    card punch
        
    All version of FORTRAN in use today use unit 5 for keyboard input, and unit 6 for output
    to the terminal.  Thus, we can read the variables able using,
    
        333    FORMAT(3I4,F8.5,A1,1X,A1,I6)
               READ(5,333) INT1,INT2,INT3,REAL1,CHAR1,CHAR2,INT4    
        
    <b>Output of formatted data</b> 
    
    Output is handled much the same as input, with two significant difference: the first
    output character is not printed but is used as a control character as specified below.
<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER CELLPADDING=5>
<tr><td><pre>
   
     First character
     in Output code       Meaning
        T<i>n</i>                Tab to location <i>n</i> on line
        /                 insert blank line
        blank             single space
        +                 no carriage control
        0                 double space line
        1                 begin line on new page
</pre></td></tr>
</table>             

    Secondly, the format list may include literal strings to be output as well as the variable
    values.  For example, we could output the values above using,
    
        334    FORMAT('+OUT:',I6,'#',I6,'#',I6'#',I6,'#',E10.3)
               WRITE(6,334) INT1,INT2,INT3,INT4,REAL1
               
    which displays, on the same line as the last output character,
    
</pre><p>              
    <table align=center><tr><td><img src="outputFields.jpg" align=right></td></tr></table>
<p><pre>   

    Note that numeric data is right-justified in fields when more space is available.  
    Character data is left-justified.  Note also that width of the decimal field may
    result in a rounded displayed value.
            
    <b>List-directed I/O</b>
     
    Modern version of FORTRAN also allow input and output to be entered via delimited entry. 
    For example, the same result as above could have been obtained from
    
        READ(5,*) INT1,INT2,INT3,INT4
        
    where all numeric values will be separated by whitespace in the input stream. Likewise,
    an output could be handled as,
    
        WRITE(6,*) ' The output values:',INT1,',',INT2,',',INT3,',',INT4
      
</pre>
