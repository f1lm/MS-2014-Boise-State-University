The bottom of the Bank.st file is what you should consider to be the 'Main' method that is comparable to the Main method inside the Bank.java file given to us by the professor. In this section, I create a few different objects and then run methods on all of them (some methods being called are within other methods, such as the toString).

The expected output should be the string representation of the bank object before and after an accrue method was invoked.
