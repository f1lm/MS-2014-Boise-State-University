There is a make file to compile a project and then a run script to run the tests. The expected output is located in expected.txt to use for comparison. There are many more tests that could be done regarding nested statements, but I believe my tests to be sufficient in showing that nested statements are possible and execute as expected.

I felt like this ia was easier than the last because it was less time consuming. I also felt that it really forced me to learn how grammer definisions will effect the intrepeter. However, I do not agree with the due date of this project. I felt like the load this class has put on me this semester is far too much and I will most likely be failing another class as a result.
