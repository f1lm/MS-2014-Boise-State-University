Comments
–-----------
This project took far more time than I initially anticipated. I did not think that it would have taken me as long as it did to comment the entire project. I also did not anticipate the “cryptic” code and 18 separate files. After the commenting, the implementations went fairly smooth. All test cases give expected results.
