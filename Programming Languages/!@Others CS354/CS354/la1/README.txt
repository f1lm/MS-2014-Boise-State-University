usage: sscm replace.scm

–------------
Description
–------------
The program replace.scm defines a replacement function that will accept in a source string, target string and replacement string. I used 8 different tests in the IDE I found, DrRacket, and all results came out as expected.

I was unable to get the program to run on Onyx because of some syntax error I could not debug.
Error: in read: reserved notation: [
But I could run it in DrRacket and get the correct outputs for all of my tests.

Also, I did not realize that the program was supposed to use atoms and lists instead of strings. My concepts are all the same but I used characters like atoms and full strings like lists.
