I was certainly not a fan of Prolog. I felt that it was a language that had a small community on the web and had little relivance to modern day programming. On the bright side, I was able to complete the project for the most part. See below for details about the output.


IMPORTANT: The program will print out each of the different time slots that I compare, then following a succesful comparison, it will print the new time slot that was found (the match). You can see by the print outs that I successfully was able to find the matching time slots but for some odd reason my recursion does not return correctly to the meet function which then returns incorrectly to the setof. I hope that by looking at these print outs and by reviewing the code, I can receive most of the credit for this project.
