Porting java to C# was quite easy. I enjoyed the massive amount of documentation on
MSDN because it made it easy to find all the functions I need with a quick Google.
The langauges are very similar in their rules and syntax. I actually did not notice
any difference in language structure, only slight syntax differences (like
inheritance).
