SigScheme 0.8.5 Release Note
============================

What's SigScheme
----------------

SigScheme is a R5RS Scheme interpreter for embedded use.

It features small footprint (64KB in library form on the 'small' configuration)
like SIOD and TinyScheme, low memory consumption (2-words per cons cell),
multibyte characters handling (UTF-8, EUCs and Shift_JIS) and more.

It is mainly developed to be the Scheme interpreter of uim.

Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - 0.8.0 introduced various system-installed Scheme libraries. Please install
    them in addition to libsscm

  - libgcroots has been updated and bundled in this release. Since it is
    installed as a separated library independent of libsscm, please create its
    own package, and make SigScheme package depending on it with
    "--with-libgcroots=installed"

  - The ABI of libsscm varies by configuration. So to make libsscm sharable,
    please specify "--enable-conf=full" and keep other feature options
    untouched for system-installed library

  - The options "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" make SigScheme
    quite heavy. Please keep them unspecified for normal library
