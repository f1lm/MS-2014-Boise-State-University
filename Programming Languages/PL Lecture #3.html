<h1>Chapter 6: Control Flow</h1>

<p><strong>Remark</strong>: We <strong>will</strong> have a midterm.
  It will be 1 hour, during recitation.
  It will <strong>not</strong> be either next monday or the monday
  after.

</p><h2>6.1: Expression Evaluation</h2>
<p>Most languages use infix notation for built in operators.
  Scheme is an exception (+ 2 (/ 9 x)).
  </p><pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="0">    function "*" (A, B: Vector) return Float is
      Result: Float :=0.0;
    begin
      for I in A'Range loop
        Result := Result + A(I)*B(I);
      end loop;
      return Result;
    end "*";
  </pre>
<p>Some languages permit the programmer to extend the infix operators.
  An example from Ada is at right.
  This example assumes Vector has already been declared as a
  one-dimensional array of floats.
  A'R gives the range of the legal subscripts, i.e. the bounds of the
  array.
  With loops like this it is not possible to access the array out of
  bounds.</p>

<h3>6.1.1: Precedence and Associativity</h3>
<p>Most languages agree on associativity, but APL is strictly right to
  left (no precedence, either).
  Normal is for most binary operators to be left associative, but
  exponentiation is right associative (also true in math).
  Why?
</p><p>Languages differ considerably in precedence (see figure 6.1 in 3e).
  The safest rule is to use parentheses unless certain.</p>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong> 1.
  We noted in Section 6.1.1 that most binary arithmetic operators are
  left-associative in most programming languages.
  In Section 6.1.4, however, we also noted that most compilers are
  free to evaluate the operands of a binary operator.
  Are these statements contradictory?
  Why or why not?</p>

<h3>6.1.2: Assignments</h3>
<p>Assignment statements are the dominant example of side effects,
  where execution does more that compute values.
  Side effects change the behavior of subsequent statements and
  expressions.</p>

<h4>References and Values</h4>
<p>There is a distinction between the container for a value
  (the <q>memory location</q>) and the value itself.
  Some values, e.g., 3+4, do not have corresponding containers and,
  among other things, cannot appear on the left hand side of an
  assignment.
  Otherwise said <q>3+4</q> is a legal r-value, but not a legal
  l-value.
  Given an l-value, the corresponding r-value can be obtained by
  <em>dereferencing</em>.
  In most languages, this dereferencing is automatic.
  Consider
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="1">    a := a + 1;
  </pre>
  the first a gives the l-value; the second the r-value.
<p></p>

<div class="optional">
  <h4>Boxing</h4>
</div>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="2">  begin
    a := if b &lt; c then d else c;
    a := begin f(b); g(c) end;
    g(d);
    2+3
  end
</pre>
<h4>Orthogonality</h4>
<p>The goal of orthogonality of features is to permit the features in
  any combination possible.
  Algol 68 emphasized orthogonality.
  Since it was an expression-oriented language, expressions could
  appear almost anywhere.
  There was no separate notion of statement.
  An example appears on the right.
  I have heard and read that this insistence on orthogonality lead to
  significant implementation difficulties.</p>

<h4>Combination Assignment Operators</h4>
<p>I suspect you all know the C syntax
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="3">    a += 4;
  </pre>
  It is no doubt often convenient, but its major significance is that
  in statements like
  <pre class="cpt" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="4">    a[f(i)] += 4;
  </pre>
  it <strong>guarantees</strong> that f(i) is evaluated only once.
  The importance of this guarantee becomes apparent if f(i) has side
  effects, e.g., if f(i) modifies i or prints.<p></p>

<h4>Multiway Assignment (and Tuples)</h4>
<p>Some languages, e.g., Perl and Python, permit tuples to be assigned
  and returned by functions, giving rise to code such as
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="5">    a, b  :=  b, a    -- swapping w/o an explicit temporary
    x, y  :=  f(5);   -- this f takes one argument and returns two results
  </pre>
<p></p>

<h3>6.1.3: Initialization</h3>
<p>Avoids the problem where an uninitialized variable has different
  values in different runs causing non-reproducible results.
  Some systems provide default initialization, for example C
  initializes external variables to zero.
</p><p>To initialize aggregates requires a way to specify aggregate
  constants.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Checks</h4>
<p>An alternative to have the system check during execution if a
  variable is uninitialized.
  For IEEE floating point this is free, since there are invalid bit
  patterns (NaN) that are checked by conforming hardware.
  To do this in general needs special hardware or expensive software
  checking.</p>

<h4>Definite Assignment</h4>
<p>Some languages, e.g., Java and C#, specify that the compiler must
  be able to show that no variable is used before given a value.
  If the compiler cannot confirm this, a warning/error message is
  produced.</p>

<h4>Constructors</h4>
<p>Some languages, e.g., Java, C++, and C# permit the program to
  provide constructors that automatically initialize dynamically
  allocated variables.</p>

<h3>6.1.4: Ordering within Expressions</h3>
<p>Which addition is done first when you evaluate X+Y+Z?
  This is not trivial: one order might overflow or give a less precise
  result.
  For expressions such as f(x)+g(x) the evaluation order matters if
  the functions have side effects.</p>

<div class="optional">
  <h4>Applying Mathematical Identities</h4>
</div>

<h3>6.1.5: Short-Circuit Evaluation</h3>
<p>Sometimes the value of the first operand determines the value of
  the entire binary operation.
  For example 0*x is 0 for any x; <q>True or X</q> is True for any X.
  Not evaluating the second operand in such cases is called a
  short-circuit evaluation.
  Note that this is not just a performance improvement; short-circuit
  evaluation changes the meaning of some programs: Consider 0*f(x),
  when f has side effects (e.g. modifying x or printing).
  We treat this issue in 6.4.1 (short-circuited conditions) when
  discussing control statements for selection.

</p><p><strong>Homework:</strong> CYU 7.
  What is an l-value? An r-value?
  CYU 11.
  What are the advantages of updating a variable with an
  <em>assignment operator</em>, rather than with a regular assignment
  in which the variable appears on both the left- and right-hand
  sides?</p>

<h2>6.2: Structured and Unstructured Flow</h2>
<p>Early languages, in particular, made heavy use of unstructured
  control flow, especially goto's.
  Much evidence was accumulated to show that the great reliance on
  goto's both increased the bug density and decreased the readability
  (these are <strong>not</strong> unrelated consequences) so today
  structured alternatives dominate.
</p><p>A famous article (actually a letter to the editor) by Dijkstra
  entitled
  <q>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</q> put the case before the
  computing public.
</p><p>Common today are
  </p><ul>
    <li>Selection
      <ul>
        <li>if statement
        </li><li>case statement
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>Iteration
      <ul>
        <li>while and repeat loops
        </li><li>for loops
        </li><li>iterators (looping over a collection)
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>Other
      <ul>
        <li>goto: Only when necessary.
        </li><li>call/return: Accomplishes more than flow control
        </li><li>exceptions
        </li><li>continuations: normally in functional languages
      </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
<p></p>

<h3>6.2.1: Structured Alternatives to goto</h3>
<p>Common uses of goto have been captured by newer control statements.
  For example, Fortran had a DO loop (similar to C's for), but had no
  way other that GOTO to exit the loop early.
  C has a break statement for that purpose.
</p><p><strong>Homework:</strong> 24.
  Rubin [Rub87] used the following example (rewritten here in C) to
  argue in favor of a goto statement.
  </p><pre data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="6">    int first_zero_row = -1     /* none */
    int i, j;
    for (i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
      for (j=0; j&lt;n; j++) {
        if (A[i][j]) goto next;
      }
      first_zero_row = i;
      break;
    next:;
    }
  </pre>
  The intent of the code is to find the first all-zero row, if any, of
  an n×n matrix.
  Do you find the example convincing?
  Is there a good structured alternative in C?
  In any language?<p></p>

<h3>Errors and Other Exceptions</h3>
<pre class="right" id="ada-exception" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="7">  begin                              begin
    x := y/z;                          x := y/z;
    z := F(y,z); -- function call      z := F(y,z);
    z := G(y,z); -- array ref          z := G(y,z);
  end;                               exception   -- handlers
                                       when Constraint_Error =&gt;
                                         -- do something
                                     end;
</pre>
<p>The Ada code on the right illustrates exception handling.
  An Ada <q>constraint error</q> signifies using an incorrect value,
  e.g., dividing by zero, accessing an array out of bounds, assigning
  a negative value to a variable declared <q>positive</q>, etc.
</p><p>Ada is statically scoped but constraints have a dynamic flavor.
  If G raises a constraint error and does not have its own handler,
  then the constraint error is propagated back to the caller of G, in
  our case the anonymous block on the right.
  Note that G is not lexically inside the block so the constraint
  error is propagating via the call chain not scoping.</p>

<div class="optional" id="for-ben">
  <pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="8">    (define f
      (lambda (c)
        (c)))
    (define g
      (lambda ()
        ;; beginning of g
        (call-with-current-continuation f)
        ;; more of g
        ))
  </pre>
  <h3>6.2.2 Continuations</h3>
  <p>A continuation encapsulates the current context, including the
    current location counter and bindings.
    Scheme contains a function
    </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="9">      (call-with-current-continuation f)
    </pre>
    that invokes f, passing to it the current continuation c.
    The simplest case occurs if a function g executes the invocation
    above and then f immediately calls c.
    The result is the same as if f returned to g.
    This example is shown on the right.
  <p>However, the continuation is a object that can be further passed
    on and can be saved and reused.
    Hence one can get back to a given context multiple times.
    Moreover, if f calls h giving it c and h calls c, we are back in g
    without having passed through f.
  </p><p>One more subtlety: The binding that contained in c
    is <q>writable</q>.
    That is, the binding is from name to memory-location-storing-the
    name, not just from name to current-value.
    So in the example above, if f changes the value of a name in the
    binding, and then calls c, g will see the change.
  </p><p>Continuations are actually quite powerful and can be used to
    implement quite a number of constructs, but the power comes with a
    warning: It is easy to (mis-)use continuations to create extremely
    obscure programs.
</p></div>

<h2>6.3: Sequencing</h2>
<p>
  </p><pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="10">    for I in 1..N loop
      -- loop body
    end loop;
  </pre>
  Many languages have a means of grouping several statements together
  to form a <q>compound statement</q>.
  Pascal used begin-end pairs to form compound statements, C shortened
  it to {}.
  Ada doesn't need {} because the language syntax already contains
  bracketing constructs.
  As an example, the code on the right is the Ada version of a simple
  C for loop.
  Note that the <q>end</q> is part of the for statement and not a
  separate begin-end compound.
<p>When declarations are combined with a sequence the result is a
  block.
  A block is written
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="11">    { declarations / statements }   declare declarations begin statements end
  </pre>
  in C and Ada respectively.
  As usual C is more compact, Ada more readable.<p></p>
<p>Another alternative is make indentation significant.
  I often use this is pseudo-code; B2/ABC/Python and Haskell use it
  for real.

</p><pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="12">  if condition then statements
  if (condition) statement

  if condition then
    statements_1
  else
    statements_2
  end if

  if condition_1 {
    statements_1 }
  else if condition_2 {
    statements_2}
  else {
    statements_3}

  if condition_1 then
    statements_1
  elsif condition_2 then
    statements_2
  ...
  elsif condition_n then
    statements_n
  end if
</pre>
<h2>6.4: Selection</h2>
<p>Essentially every language has an if statement to use for selection.
  The simplest case is shown in the first two lines on the right.
  Something is needed to separate the condition from the statement.
  In Pascal and Ada it is the <strong>then</strong> keyword;
  in C/C++/Java it is the parentheses surrounding the condition.
</p><p>The next step up is if-then-else, introduced in Algol 60.
  We have already seen the infamous <q>dangling else</q> problem that
  can occur if statements_1 is an <strong>if</strong>.
  If the language uses end markers like <strong>end if</strong>, the
  problem disappears; Ada uses this approach, which is shown on the
  right.
  Another solution, used by Algol 60, is to forbid a
  <strong>then</strong> to be followed immediately by
  an <strong>if</strong> (you can follow <strong>then</strong> by a
  <strong>begin</strong> block starting with <strong>if</strong>).
</p><p>When there are more than 2 possibilities, it is common to employ
  <strong>else if</strong>.
  The C/C++/Java syntax is shown on the right.
  This same idea could be used in languages featuring
  <strong>end if</strong>, but the result would be a bunch
  of <strong>end if</strong> statements at the end.
  To avoid requiring this somewhat ugly code, languages like Ada
  include an <strong>elsif</strong> which continues the
  existing <strong>if</strong> rather than starting a new one.
  Thus only one <strong>end if</strong> is required as we see in the
  bottom right example.</p>

<h3>6.4.1: Short-Circuit Conditions (and Evaluation)</h3>
<p>Can <q>if (y==0 || 1/y &lt; 100)</q> ever divide by zero?<br>
  Not in C which <strong>requires</strong> short-circuit evaluation.
</p><p>In addition to divide by zero cases, short-circuit evaluation is
  helpful when searching a null-terminated list in C.
  In that situation the idiom is
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="13">    while (ptr &amp;&amp; ptr-&gt;val != value)
  </pre>
  The short circuit evaluation of &amp;&amp; guarantees that we will
  never execute <tt>null-&gt;val</tt>.
<p>But sometimes we do not want to short-circuit the evaluation.
  For example, consider f(x)&amp;&amp;g(x) where g(x) has a desirable
  side effect that we want to employ even when f(x) is false.
  In C this cannot be done directly.</p>
<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="14">  if C1 and C2  -- always eval C2
  if C1 and then C2 -- not always
</pre>
<p>Ada has both possibilities.
  The operator <strong>or</strong> always evaluates both arguments;
  whereas, the operator <strong>or else</strong> does a short circuit
  evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong> 12.
  Neither Algol 60 nore Algol 68 employs short-circuit evaluation for
  Boolean expressions.
  In both languages, however, an
  <tt>if...then...else</tt> construct can be used as an expression.
  Show how to use <tt>if...then...else</tt> to achieve the effect of
  short-circuit evaluations.</p>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="15">  case nextChar is
    when 'I'    =&gt; Value := 1;
    when 'V'    =&gt; Value := 5;
    when 'X'    =&gt; Value := 10;
    when 'C'    =&gt; Value := 100;
    when 'D'    =&gt; Value := 500;
    when 'M'    =&gt; Value := 1000;
    when others =&gt; raise InvalidRomanNumeral;
  end case;
</pre>
<h3>6.4.2 Case/Switch Statements</h3>
<p>Most modern languages have a case or switch statement where the
  selection is based on the value of a single expression.
  The code on the right was written in Ada by a student of ancient
  Rome.
  The raise instruction causes an exception to be raised and thus
  control is transferred to the
  <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall09/G22.2110-001/lectures/lecture-03.html#ada-exception">appropriate handler</a>.
</p><p>A case statement can always be simulated by a sequence of if
  statements, but the case statement is clearer.</p>

<h4>(Alternative) Implementations</h4>
<p>In addition to increased clarity over multiple if statements, the
  case statement can, in many situations be compiled into better code.
  Most languages having this construct require that the tested for
  values ('I', 'V', 'X', 'C', 'D', and 'M' above) must be computable
  at compile time.
  For example in Ada, they must be manifest constants, or ranges such
  as 5..8 composed of manifest constants, or a disjunction of these
  (e.g., 6 | 9..20 | 8).</p>
<div class="optional">
  <p>In the simplest case where each choice is a constants, a jump
    table can be constructed and just two jumps are executed,
    independent of the number of cases.
    The size of the jump table is the range of choices so would be
    impractical if the case expression was an arbitrary integer.
    If the when arms formed consecutive integers, the implementation
    would jump to others if out of range (using comparison operators)
    and then use a jump table for the when arms.
  </p><p>Hashing techniques are also used (see 3e).
    In the general case the code produced is a bunch of tests and
    tables.
  </p>
</div>

<h4>Syntax and Label Semantics</h4>
<p>The languages differ in details.
  The words <q>case</q> and <q>when</q> in Ada become <q>switch</q>
  and <q>case</q> in C.
  Ada requires that all possible values of the case expression be
  accounted for (the <strong>others</strong> construct makes this
  easy).
  C and Fortran 90 simply do nothing when the expression does not
  match any arm even though C does support a <strong>default</strong>
  arm.</p>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="16">  switch (x+3) {
    case 2:  statements_2
             break;
    case 1:  statements_1
             break;
    case 6:  statements_6   // NO break between
    case 5:  statements_5   // cases 6 and 5
             break;
    default: something
  }
</pre>
<h4>The C switch Statement</h4>
<p>The C switch statement is rather peculiar.
  There are no ranges allowed and the cases flow from one to the other
  unless there is a break, a common cause of errors for beginners.
  So if x is 3, x+3 is 6 and both statements_6 and statements_5 are
  executed.
</p><p>Indeed, the cases are really just statement labels.
  This can lead to quite unstructured code including the infamous ...</p>

<h5>Duff's Device (R Rated—Don't Show This to Minors)</h5>
<pre class="compactRight" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="17">  void send (int *to, int *from, int count) {
    int n = (count + 7) /8;
    switch (count % 8) {
      case 0: do { *to++ = *from++;
      case 7:      *to++ = *from++;
      case 6:      *to++ = *from++;
      case 5:      *to++ = *from++;
      case 4;      *to++ = *from++;
      case 3:      *to++ = *from++;
      case 2:      *to++ = *from++;
      case 1:      *to++ = *from++;
                 } while (--n &gt; 0);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>This function is actually perfectly legal C code.
  It was discovered by Tom Duff, a very strong graphics programmer,
  formerly at Bell Labs now at Pixar.
  The normal way to copy n integers is to loop n times.
  But that requires n tests and n jumps.
</p><p>Duff <q>unrolled</q> the loop 8 times meaning that he looped n/8
  times with each body copying 8 integers.
  Unrolling is a well known technique, nothing new yet.
  But, if n is say 804, then after doing 100 iterations with 8 copies,
  you need to do one extra iteration to copy the last 4.
  The standard technique is to write two loops, one does n/8
  iterations with 8 copies, the other does n%8 iterations with one
  copy.
  Duff's device uses only one loop.
</p><p>Compiler technology has improved since Duff created the device and
  Wikipedia says that when it was removed from part of the
  X-window system, performance increased.</p>

<h2>6.5: Iteration</h2>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="18">  for I in A..N loop statements end loop;
  for (int i=A; i&lt;n; i++) { statements }
</pre>
<h3>6.5.1: Enumeration-Controlled Loops</h3>
<p>On the right we see the basic for loop from Ada and C.</p>

<div class="optional">
  <h4>Code Generation For for Loops</h4>
</div>

<h4>Possibilities / Design Issues (Semantic Complications)</h4>
<p>There is a tension between flexibility and clarity.
  An Ada advocate would say that for loops are just for iterating
  over a domain; there are other (e.g., <strong>while</strong>) loops
  that should be used for other cases.
  A C advocate finds the for(;;) construct an expressive and concise
  way to implement important idioms.
</p><p>This tension leads to different answers for several design
  questions.
  </p><ul>
    <li>Evaluation of loop bounds:<br>
      Many languages evaluate the bounds only once, before the
      iterations start; however, C and successors evaluate the clauses
      in the for statement each iteration.
    </li><li>Scope and mutability of loop index:<br>
      Many languages have the index (I above) automatically declared
      to be local to the loop.
      In the example C loop, I explicitly declared the index to be
      local.
      One difference between the two examples is that in Ada the index
      I is a constant, which prevents both accidental and deliberate
      change of the index by the statements in the loop body.
    </li><li>Non-unit Increments:<br>
      Many languages, including C, permit the increment to be an arbitrary
      value.
      Indeed, in C the <q>increment clause</q> need not increment at
      all.
      In Ada the increment is implicit; the result is that the loop
      travels through the entire range specified after
      <strong>in</strong>.
    </li><li>Reverse Order Iterations:<br>
      One possibility that Ada does
      offer is to travel backwards through the range using
      <pre class="cpt" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="19">        for i in reverse A..N loop statements end loop;
      </pre>

      Many languages, including Ada, permit the range to be any
      discrete set.
      So an enumeration type is permitted as shown on the right, but a
      range of Floats is not.
    </li><li>Null Loops:<br>
      What happens if N &lt; A?
      Nearly all languages execute <em>no</em> iterations.
      That is, the termination test is performed before the body
      executes.
      A famous exception is Fortran, which tests at the bottom of the
      loop and hence always executes at least one iteration.

<h3>6.5.2: Combination Loops</h3>
<p>The C <strong>for</strong> loop is actually quite close to the
  <strong>while</strong> loops we discuss below since the three clause
  within the <strong>for</strong> can be arbitrary expressions,
  including assignments and other side-effects.
  Indeed the for loop on the right is defined by C to have the same
  semantics as the while loop below it unless the statements in the
  body include a <strong>continue</strong> statement.
</p><p>Loops combining both enumeration and logical control are also found
  in Algol 60 and Common Lisp.</p>

<h3>6.5.3: Iterators</h3>
<p>We saw above an example of a loop with range an enum
  Weekday=(Mon,Tues,Wed,Thurs,Fri).
  More generally, some languages, e.g., Clu, Python, Ruby, C++,
  Euclid, and C# permit the programmer to provide an <em>iterator</em>
  with any <em>container</em> (an object of a discrete type).
  </p><pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="22">    <strong>for</strong> (thing=first(); anyMore(); thing=next()); {
      statements
    };
  </pre>
<p>The programmer then writes <q>first</q>, <q>next</q>, and
  <q>anyMore</q> operators that in succession yield all elements of
  the container.
  So the generalization of the C <strong>for</strong> loop becomes
  something like the code on the right.
</p><p>As an example imagine a binary tree considered as a container of
  nodes.
  One could write three different iterators: preorder, postorder, and
  inorder.
  Then, using the appropriate iterator in the loop shown above would
  perform a preorder/postorder/inorder traversal of the tree.</p>

<h3>6.5.5: Logically Controlled Loops</h3>
<p>Essentially all languages have <strong>while</strong> loops of the
  general form
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="23">    while condition loop statements end loop;
  </pre>
  In while loops the condition is tested each iteration before the
  statements are executed.
  In particular, if the condition is initially false,
  <strong>no</strong> iterations are executed.
<p>In fact all loops can be expressed using this form, for suitable
  conditions and statements.
  This <q>universality</q> proves useful when performing
  invariant/assertion reasoning and proving programs consistent with
  their specifications.</p>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="24">  <strong>repeat</strong> statements <strong>until</strong> condition;
  <strong>do</strong> { statements } <strong>while</strong> (condition);

  first := true;
  <strong>while</strong> (first <strong>or else</strong> condition) loop
    statements
    first := false;
  <strong>end loop;</strong>
</pre>
<h4>Post-test Loops</h4>
<p>Sometimes we want to perform the test at the bottom of the loop
  (and thus execute the body at least once).
  The first two lines on the right show how this is done in Pascal and
  C respectively.
  The difference between the two is that the repeat-until construct
  terminates when the condition is true; whereas, the do-while
  terminates when the condition is false.
</p><p>The do-while is more popular.
  One language that has neither is Ada so code like the bottom right
  is needed to simulate do-while.</p>

<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="25">  Outer: <strong>while</strong> C1 <strong>loop</strong>
    statements_1a
    Mid: <strong>while</strong> C2 <strong>loop</strong>
      statements_2a
      <strong>exit</strong> outer <strong>when</strong> condition_fini;
      inner:<strong>while</strong> C3 <strong>loop</strong>
        statements_3
        <strong>exit when</strong> condition_2b;
        <strong>exit</strong> mid <strong>when</strong> condition_1b;
      <strong>end loop</strong> inner;
      statements_2b
    <strong>end loop</strong> mid;
    statements_1b
  <strong>end loop</strong> outer;
</pre>
<h4>Midtest Loops</h4>
<p>More generally, we might want to break out of a loop somewhere
  <q>in the middle</q>, that is, at an arbitrary point in the body.
  Many languages offer this ability, in C/C++ it is the
  <strong>break</strong> statement.
</p><p>Even more generally, we might want to break out of a nested loop.
  Indeed, if we are nested three deep, we might want to end the two
  innermost loops and continue with the outer loop at the point where
  the middle loop ends.
</p><p>In C/C++ a <strong>goto</strong> is needed to break out of several
  layers; Java extends the C/C++ <strong>break</strong> with labels to
  support multi-level breaks; and Ada uses <strong>exit</strong> to
  break out and a labeled exit (as shown on the right) for multi-level
  breaks.
</p><p>For example, if condition_fini evaluates <strong>true</strong>, the
  entire loop nest is exited; if condition_2b evaluates
  <strong>true</strong>, statements_2b is executed; and if condition_1b
  evaluates <strong>true</strong>, statements_1b is executed.</p>

<h2>6.6: Recursion</h2>
<p>We will discuss recursion again when we study subprograms.
  Here we just want to illustrate its relationship to iteration.

</p><h3>6.6.1: Iteration and Recursion</h3>
<p>Although iteration is indicated by a keyword statement such as
  <q>while</q>, <q>for</q>, or <q>loop</q>, and recursion is indicated
  by a procedure/function invocation, the concepts are more closely
  related than the divergent syntax suggests.
  Both iteration and recursion are used to enable a section to be
  executed repeatedly.</p>
<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="26">  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int summation (int (*f)(int x), int low, int high) {
      int total = 0;
      int i;
      for (i = low; i &lt;= high; i++) {
          total += (*f)(i);
      }
      return total;
  }
  int square(int x) {
      return x * x;
  }
  int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
      printf ("Ans is %d", summation(&amp;square,1,3));
      return 0;
  }

  (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
  (define summation
    (lambda (f lo hi)
      (cond
       ((&gt; lo hi) 0)
       ((= lo hi) (f lo))
     (else (+ (summation f lo (- hi 1)) (f hi))))))
  (summation square 1 3)

  (summation (lambda (x) (* x x)) 1 3)
</pre>
<p>On the right we see three versions of a function to compute
  </p><pre class="compact" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="27">    Sum (from i = lo) (to i = hi) f(i)
  </pre>
  given three parameters, lo, hi, and (a pointer to) f.
  <ol>
    <li>The first version uses iteration.
      It is written in C, which does not support passing functions as
      parameters, but does support passing pointers to functions.
      This explains the specification of the first parameter of
      summation.
      As an aside, C is willing to do some automatic type conversions
      (called coercions) so the &amp; could be omitted and the loop
      body could say f(i).
      However, it is important to note that the first argument to
      summation is a pointer <strong>not</strong> a function.<br><br>
    </li><li>The second version is in scheme and uses recursion.
      The reason the recursion goes down from hi rather than up from
      lo is so that the arithmetic is done in the same order as with
      the iterative version.<br><br>
    </li><li>The third version uses the same definition of summation as
      does the second, but uses the anonymous function directly and
      thus doesn't need (or have) any mention of the name square.
  </li></ol>
<p></p>

<h4>Tail Recursion</h4>
<p>A recursive function is called <em class="def">tail recursive</em>
  if the <strong>last</strong> thing it does before returning is to
  invoke itself recursively.
</p><p>In this case we do <strong>not</strong> need to keep multiple
  copies of the local variables since, when one invocation calls the
  next, the first is <q>finished with</q> its copy of the variables
  and the second one can reuse them rather than pushing another set of
  local variables on the stack.
  This is very helpful for for performance.</p>
<pre class="right" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="28">  int gcc (int a, int b) {               int gcc (int a, int b) {
    				         start:
    if (a == b) return a;      	           if (a == b) return a;
    if (a &gt; b) return gcd(a-b,b);          if (a &gt; b) {
                                             a = a-b; goto start; }
    return gcd(a,b-a); }                   b = b-a; goto start; }
</pre>
<p>The two examples on the right are from the book and show equivalent
  C programs for gcd: the left (tail-) recursive, the right iterative.
  Both versions assume the parameters are positive.
  Good compilers (especially, those for <q>functional languages</q>
  will automatically convert tail recursive functions into equivalent
  iterative form.</p>

<h4>Thinking Recursively</h4>
<p>I very much recommend the book <em>The Little Schemer</em> by
  Friedman and Felleisen.
