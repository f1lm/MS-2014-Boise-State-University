<p>What if we built a house via agile?  Oops! Wrong foundation. Ok, refactor.  Oops! bathroom in the kitchen.  Ok, refactor.  Oops! No stairs to the second floor.  OK, out of money!  <br>People who can't plan and can't manage love agile.  People who want a complex, integrated and coherent product at a predictable point in time, not so much.  Notice that *all* of the agile examples are trivial, incremental changes to a solid existing base.  If you are building a birdhouse, agile is fine.  If you a building a sky scraper, better have it well planned up front.  Same scale goes for software.  Agile doesn't scale, and is terrible for completely new development.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the case for Agile in the ways I have seen it implemented; in most cases it was merely used as a cover for incompetent technical management.</p><p>Agile is primarily based upon the original XP paradigm, which turned out to be a complete failure if you know the history as to how this nonsense came about.  Agile has been an attempt to mitigate the failures of its predecessor.  According to most recent project failure statistics, the claim of Agile as a beneficial paradigm has not been born out.</p><p>Agile is also nothing new even when it was new.  It is primarily a re-invention of the software engineering paradigms of 'evolutionary" and\or "incremental" design.  However, there are actually 13 software engineering design paradigms, ALL of which have some form of "Waterfall" process involved.  In other words, each design paradigm has its own form of preparatory design standard no matter how small the component being developed.</p><p>The idea that anyone can design good software without a design plan has only been successful as a promotional strategy for people who like to promote the idea of their version of "Rapid Application Development" for software projects that most often break most engineering principals of which software development is a sister category.  In reality it simply cannot be done.</p><p>Software development is the process of building a product, though it is made up of magnetically stored bits and bytes.  In essence (and it has been documented as such), it follows the same paradigm as does technical manufacturing, which has become a highly mature and sophisticated process over the years because of that area's attention to quality design and implementation; not the fact that design was mitigated as much as possible.</p><p>Software Engineering, though in of itself a mature, successful process has not been incorporated nearly to the extent that similar, modernized, engineering principals have been implemented into manufacturing processes leaving software development as immature a process as it was in the 1960s.</p><p>If this were not the case and Agile was such a panacea maybe then we should deign our cars this way or our aircraft (Well the F-35 appears to have used the Agile concept since the result has been so disastrous).  Or maybe we should design life and death systems in this fashion.  Who needs design plans for such things as new cardiac surgery processes that are governed by software?</p><p>If anyone here wants to fly on a plane that was designed and built with an Agile-like process, raise your hands!  Aircraft design and its corresponding software development DOES NOT use Agile since they leave that for stupid business people.</p><p>Finally, the idea that Agile provides for building smaller components to an overall project faster is somewhat disingenuous.  Many of the components that senior developers build during a project do not in fact require up front design as our experience has shown what works and what doesn't.  Nonetheless, it still takes time to put project specific coding together successfully and the necessary timelines still have to be part of a design plan.</p><p>All this being said, there are efficient ways to mitigate some of the design aspects to any project since foundational components most often have been implemented in the same ways for many projects and those experienced with them, as I have just noted, do not require extensive design and planning for them.  However, the design phase of any project is not just about the technical features but also include risk factor analysis and proper timeline analysis.</p><p>And it is these two last factors that Agile promoters try so hard to avoid, streamline, or water down so they can look good to their own management, which is of primary importance to them.</p><p>If such project managers would spend more time teaching business management about the costs and risks of rushing and\or speeding up development processes than maybe we would not be having this continuous debate as to whether Agile is good or not.  The fact that we are does not bode well for the Agile world.</p><p>This is where the actual problem lays with this entire discussion; it is not about software design and development but how fast can a project get done.  And that has always been the problem with technical management since most technical management never had a good grasp of software engineering in the first place...</p><p>Steve Naidamast<br>  Sr. Software Engineer<br></p>

<p>OK, then. Look, in a lot cases the Customer does not even understand what he really wants. He has some loosely related "features" in mind, but how is the project getting there, are these features non-contradictory, or even implementable,  - he has no idea at all. Working in Waterfall paradigm in this case means that all of these "wishes" be fully analyzed in all their complexity (which is often impossible without creating some prototypes), then the UI/UX prototypes be drawn and agreed upon, only then developers can possibly start coding, and only afterwards the testers will be testing the project against initial requirements, and only after that the deployment begins. And far too often at this point the Customer understands, that in fact he wanted something completely different, or the way these features are implemented, are in fact not necessary, or his marketing position/ambitions are already changed, etc., etc.</p><p>Agile is a protective measure in this case. It allows to quickly build proof-of-concept versions, allows to adapt to requirement changes more effectively, and most important it bridges the gap between "wanting" and "getting" thus reducing risks of potentially building a huge, nice and excellently working... piece of crap.</p><p>It's absolutely incorrect to compare the process of creating software for startups (or any consumer business, for that matter)  with building space stations, jet fighters, or even houses. Your requirements to space station, MRT-machine or jet fighter, even a house, are a result of decades of expertise, probably paid by thousands of lives, and you are not going to change them every now and then, which happens alas far too often in customer software development.</p><p>To put it shortly: I would be happy to work in Waterfall paradigm, but it's too big a luxury to afford in real world.</p>

<p>Well this is why in "the real world" so much business software development is of so low quality.</p><p>In addition, I did not say that you had to use the "waterfall" approach as is for all software development projects.  I described the fact that there are standardized software engineering alternatives that allow for differing forms of development as a result of differing requirements.  Nonetheless, all of them have some level of a "waterfall" approach to them as all software design does.</p><p>What your comment describes is that in "the real world" we should all just do "guerrilla programming" and just forget quality standards because the customer simply can't wait or wants to change his or her specifications to their heart's content.  Well, when you do that you produce crap...</p>

<p>Agile is crap.<br>It is just a validator for those too weak minded to be able to design. That is not to say that strict waterfall is a panacea, but if you can't design, why do you think you can code.</p><p>If the requirements are so ill defied at the start that a design cannot be done then this is a prototype, not a product. I have no arguments against prototypes, just against shipping them. Yes, requirements do change and this must be recognized at the earliest opportunity but writing code should nut be the mechanism for discovering them.</p><p>Scrums are an unnecessary complication and constraint. Doing good software is hard enough without adding unnecessary pain. It is perfectly possible to track progress without forcing the work into artificial time slots. This just encourages short cuts and hacks just to be able to tick the completed box before the two weeks, or whatever, is up.</p><p>Yes, involve the customer, but any suggestion that the customer or any non-technical person has any say in the order of work is ludicrous. The development sequence is an engineering decision, non-technical people should not even be in the room. This goes for suitably non-qualified Project Managers too.</p><p>What really amuses me is the term "Refactoring". Be honest, this is rewriting because you got it wrong, again, and again. Do it right, do it once.</p>

<p>This article is just a sequence of regurgitated opinions on why agile is better.</p><p>For me to take anything you say seriously you are going to have to back up assertions like the following (to name just a few) with some objective data:</p><p>"Code is then written, often by pairs of developers collaborating and acting as an instant checks and balances system, and tested against that test script on a continuous basis. This allows for any errors to be caught during the development process and fixed in real time. On the other hand, in a waterfall process, all development is finished before testing begins, which leaves room for a backlog of errors to have built up. Some glitches may be difficult to find, and the testing process takes longer as a consequence."</p><p>"agile development also makes it easier for development teams to cope with changing requirements"</p><p>"This means the software delivered at the end of a project is likely to be better suited to the user’s purpose"</p><p>There are some surveys to suggest that Agile and Lean are performing better than other methodologies but then again they are surveys and by nature subjective.</p>

<p>Agile is a<br>front for contractors like the author of this article to get into your<br>organization. Contractors with no discernable skills other than the ability to<br>sell “Blue Sky” to lazy managers, hold scrums that do little more than take up<br>time. Internal talentless entities feed on Agile to preserve their useless existence.<br>The developers who actually do the work are devalued and are demeaned.  Take a look at the want ads on line Scrum<br>Master. There is no shortage of no talent personnel, and rows of job offerings<br>for developers.</p>

<p>"development and testing happen concurrently"... this is a difficult thing. Development is a top-down process, while testing is a bottom-up process. Testing begins at units tests, then functional tests for modules, integration tests ... regression tests. Development begins at the business level operational concept down to the implementation details.</p>

<p>Nobody talks about how Agile gets in the way of real work.<br>I've been through countless Agile oriented software development projects, and it gets in the way.<br>Before the Agile oriented project even begins, EVERYTHING is mapped out. This includes expectations of each development sprint, and when they are expected to be completed. But as any real dev/tester/manager knows, stuff happens, and the deadlines are not met.</p><p>Rather than doing real work, the Agile project managers mandate absolute deadlines for the shorter dev periods with no flexibility. This causes the devs and testers to code specifically to the letter of the expectations of the Agile deadlines. The result is a software project riddled with bugs and holes because of unanticipated items that came up in the middle of a software dev cycle.<br>A better solution is to try to anticipate for unexpected items. If something comes up, then either address it right then, or add on another cycle somewhere down the line.<br>I've been with too many incompetent software managers who stuck to a schedule, and ended up with an inferior product.</p><p>Agile is a load of crap.</p>

<p>Hate to say it, but what you've been doing isn't Agile. The whole idea is to be, well, Agile, that means having a loose road map is okay, but then you should be reacting to change.</p><p>The teams should be self organising, choosing the work to be done, and are expected to work in a professional way, i.e not produce low quality, bug ridden work.</p>

<p>Yep.</p><p>Agile is a process optimized for developer-tester drones that don't think for themselves (which is great for outsourcing).  If design is part of the developer's job, agile breaks down often times.</p><p>Why?  Like you said, unanticipated things come up.  Out-sourced drones often won't recognize or want to expose issues-- it complicates the work they are doing-- that they often must complete within a very very tight deadline.  Outsourced developers don't care, they're likely off on something else next sprint!   Hey maybe their H1B visa is expiring and they won't even be here in two weeks!</p><p>This process is great for older software companies who's products are in maintenance anyway, in decline so to speak.  You don't need skilled developers to increment version numbers and refresh splash screens.  Most large software companies are nothing but software sales/marketing engines anyway, so it's great for them as well.  Since most of their work is outsourced.  Think Symantec, and their ilk.</p><p>Oh wait...look at who the author of this article works for...an outsourcing company!  Brilliant!</p>
